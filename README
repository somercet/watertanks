ChatView for an IM client in GTK3.

Uses the log files, not scrollback files, as the latter are far too cluttered to
migrate, I believe.  Proper format is:

2024-02-15T14:58:14Z <tab> <username> <tab> message

Much want to insist on ISO 8601 *including* time zone.

Any line with less than two tabs is silently replaced with an empty line.
"text2" file contains broken lines to test widget.

Marker line, save and colored text are empty "return" funcs.  No sense getting
that involved until final form of widget is worked out.  Highlight all is not
implemented for now.

There is an aborted attempt to use GSettings in this for now, so the schema
needs to be added to /usr/local and then glib-compile-schemas(1) needs to
be run on that directory.
