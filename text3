2024-01-25T23:42:56-0500	<mrrabbit_>	Hi
2024-01-25T23:43:24-0500	<mrrabbit_>	I often use Tor to protect my privacy in Alpine Linux, but I find that searching is too slow. Are there any ways to help me search?
2024-01-25T23:50:09-0500	<thomas25>	do you guys follow agile development practices?
2024-01-25T23:50:59-0500	<thomas25>	pragma- i can't believe you are still here, i think you've been here for about 20 years at least.
2024-01-25T23:52:21-0500	<pnbeast>	When I code, I usually have a cup of tea that sits on a table about 20 degrees behind me, so I have to twist around pretty far to grab it.  Does that count?
2024-01-25T23:52:57-0500	<rbox>	oh yeah, all the ceremonies and everyhting
2024-01-25T23:53:09-0500	<rbox>	i actually saw a job posting once that talked about doing the agile ceremonies
2024-01-25T23:53:13-0500	<rbox>	i started laughing
2024-01-25T23:53:17-0500	<osmten>	Hey, If I have two arrays char arr[4096] which is statically allocated and one char *arr = (char *)malloc(4096); dynamicallyÂ  . Which memory access will be faster?
2024-01-25T23:53:34-0500	<rbox>	osmten: memory is memory
2024-01-25T23:54:13-0500	<thomas25>	rbox i'm aiming to almost remove dailies with some devops stuff
2024-01-25T23:54:48-0500	<thomas25>	osmten first one is more likely to be faster but you shouldn't care
2024-01-25T23:54:51-0500	<osmten>	rbox: oh, so I was thinking maybe statically allocated will be stored in a process stack which maybe faster. But it don't matter
2024-01-25T23:54:51-0500	<rbox>	at my work we do a meeting on monday morning, and thats about it
2024-01-25T23:55:42-0500	<osmten>	osmten: what can be the reason of first one being faster?
2024-01-25T23:55:54-0500	<thomas25>	1) static allocation itself is costless (malloc is much more expensive) 2) accessing a nearby memory tends to be faster in instruction level
2024-01-25T23:56:14-0500	<rbox>	nearby to what
2024-01-25T23:56:20-0500	<thomas25>	current instruction
2024-01-25T23:56:33-0500	<rbox>	you're not runnig instuctions from the stack
2024-01-25T23:56:44-0500	<thomas25>	do your own research from this point on
2024-01-25T23:56:46-0500	<thomas25>	i'm not here to argue
2024-01-25T23:56:47-0500	<thomas25>	:)
2024-01-25T23:56:49-0500	<rbox>	lol
2024-01-25T23:57:17-0500	<thomas25>	dropping wisdom of more than 2 decades y'all *drops mic*
2024-01-26T00:01:07-0500	<Xgc>	osmten: There are more factors involved.  The answer is, it depends. It's not just about how the memory was allocated, but also the kind of instruction used to access, plus lots of other things, including available kinds of cache and the current state of the cache.
2024-01-26T00:01:51-0500	<Xgc>	osmten: That's just skimming the surface.
2024-01-26T00:02:37-0500	<caze>	osmten: If you cast the first one, that will be just as fast as the malloc one.
2024-01-26T00:02:38-0500	<Xgc>	osmten: Remember, C guarantees almost none of this.
2024-01-26T00:03:24-0500	<osmten>	osmten: so it depends on the architecture of cpu, caches e.t.c
2024-01-26T00:03:58-0500	<Xgc>	osmten: and how your compiler maps your program to that architecture.
2024-01-26T00:04:30-0500	<Xgc>	s/compiler/compiler and C runtime environment/
2024-01-26T00:05:11-0500	<osmten>	Xgc: oh ok Thanks
2024-01-26T00:05:21-0500	<caze>	osmten: Why would the process stack be faster?
2024-01-26T00:08:24-0500	<osmten>	caze: It's just I though maybe the process specific data is there like registers, e.t.c. I wasn't sure just wanted to confirm
2024-01-26T00:09:24-0500	<rbox>	registers have nothign to do with the stack
2024-01-26T00:09:56-0500	<caze>	osmten: You mean *in* the registers?
2024-01-26T00:10:26-0500	<osmten>	osmten: No
2024-01-26T00:16:06-0500	<sirj>	133
2024-01-26T00:18:16-0500	<Xgc>	osmten: It's complicated... and more complicated than any of the above admits.  Books have been written about the subject.
2024-01-26T00:21:03-0500	<thomas25>	sure, it's complicated. if any access is faster, you can bet your money it's the closer one though
2024-01-26T00:21:10-0500	<thomas25>	you can simplify things and make some ground rules
2024-01-26T00:21:23-0500	<thomas25>	where it really matters, you examine the situation deeply of course
2024-01-26T00:21:39-0500	<caze>	"closer"?
2024-01-26T00:24:39-0500	<Xgc>	thomas25: Try defining "closer".  It's going to be an interesting effort.
2024-01-26T00:26:06-0500	<Xgc>	thomas25: Consider a 1 byte address difference that spans a page boundary or leads to a cache miss.
2024-01-26T00:26:31-0500	<Xgc>	thomas25: Are these two bytes "close"?
2024-01-26T00:29:01-0500	<Xgc>	Maybe we're about to be interrupted between those byte accesses to complicate things even more.
2024-01-26T00:35:41-0500	<voldial>	I am trying to construct a path with std.fmt.allocPrint and then pass it to os.system.stat() but I am creating the wrong type: error: expected type '[*:0]const u8', found '[]u8' https://bpa.st/J5QQ (re-reading the various zig 101 docs until someone throws me a bone:)
2024-01-26T00:36:06-0500	<voldial>	I tried @constCast(string) but nothing changed
2024-01-26T00:38:22-0500	<voldial>	runnable example: https://zigbin.io/0095ed
2024-01-26T00:38:56-0500	<torque>	you need `allocPrintZ` to get a 0-terminated slice
2024-01-26T00:39:10-0500	<voldial>	oh. that 0 means null?
2024-01-26T00:39:50-0500	<torque>	[*:0]const u8 is a 0-terminated pointer to many u8, aka essentially a C string
2024-01-26T00:41:17-0500	<torque>	I don't remember if slices automatically decay to many-item pointers. however you can explicitly get a many-item pointer from a slice with `myslice.ptr`
2024-01-26T00:41:32-0500	<madprops>	hi jeho, i was thinking of a plugin idea
2024-01-26T00:41:36-0500	<torque>	take a look at https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Sentinel-Terminated-Pointers
2024-01-26T00:41:54-0500	<madprops>	imagine if the menubar channel switcher entries could be updates on activity
2024-01-26T00:42:08-0500	<madprops>	like update them when a message is posted in a channel
2024-01-26T00:42:11-0500	<voldial>	torque: excellent. that worked.
2024-01-26T00:42:12-0500	<madprops>	with some counter or just *
2024-01-26T00:42:25-0500	<somercet>	menubar?
2024-01-26T00:42:29-0500	<madprops>	i guess it would imply removing and reinserting the item
2024-01-26T00:42:30-0500	<madprops>	yeah
2024-01-26T00:43:02-0500	<madprops>	but it's a wild idea
2024-01-26T00:43:40-0500	<somercet>	where in the menubar?
2024-01-26T00:45:26-0500	<voldial>	if I examine stat_result for a path that does not exist, like "/et" it's a big number. For paths that exist, it's 0. What if anything does the nonzero return value tell? I see the os.system.stat function sig, it's rreturning usize... example: https://zigbin.io/add30b
2024-01-26T00:45:31-0500	<somercet>	Are you  referring to the channel switcher?
2024-01-26T00:46:22-0500	<somercet>	or the systray?
2024-01-26T00:47:49-0500	<torque>	`man 2 stat` on my system says "Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error."
2024-01-26T00:48:36-0500	<torque>	note that os.system.stat is a low-level API. You probably want to use a higher level API that will unwrap errno for you into a proper zig error on failure
2024-01-26T00:49:19-0500	<voldial>	torque: ah, so I was using {d} instead of {u}
2024-01-26T00:49:21-0500	<madprops>	somercet, the other day we found that we can add channel shortcuts to the menubar
2024-01-26T00:49:33-0500	<madprops>	like /menu add "Cats" "doat Libera.Chat join #cats"
2024-01-26T00:49:36-0500	<madprops>	it adds an entry
2024-01-26T00:49:39-0500	<madprops>	a bit of a hack
2024-01-26T00:49:44-0500	<somercet>	ah
2024-01-26T00:50:14-0500	<torque>	for example, fs.File.stat
2024-01-26T00:52:18-0500	<voldial>	is there somewhere I can read about why File would be capitalized? I see it in the stdlib src, pub const File = @import("fs/File.zig");
2024-01-26T00:52:33-0500	<torque>	it's because the file itself is a struct
2024-01-26T00:53:06-0500	<voldial>	ohh. so structs are by convention starting with a cap?
2024-01-26T00:53:24-0500	<torque>	the zig convention is that all type names use CamelCase
2024-01-26T00:53:45-0500	<torque>	https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Names
2024-01-26T00:53:59-0500	<voldial>	ah great. reading
2024-01-26T01:16:44-0500	<thomas25>	Xgc you think i said "stack is always faster. period."?
2024-01-26T01:17:31-0500	<thomas25>	what i'm saying is "stack access if generally faster than heap access" it's a safe assumption. and more than enough for the person asked the question.
2024-01-26T01:19:33-0500	<thomas25>	it depends on tons of stuff, but that's a safe assumption to make. since you can't have all the CPUs and study their caching behaviour, or instruction sets addressing mode performance implications. and i can't imagine a case where stack is slower than heap. can you provide an example?
2024-01-26T02:05:17-0500	<qaqland>	mrrabbit_: search alpine linux packages online?
2024-01-26T02:14:41-0500	<somercet>	mrrabbit_, you're looking for a general purpose Tor channel.
2024-01-26T02:21:15-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Alright, I found out you can disable the fmt by adding a certain comment on top of source files, while cumbersome it's good enough for me to come back to Zig again.

2024-01-26T02:51:45-0500	<zcrayfish>	It's hard to even define it. Not all of Google's IP address space is even used by Google. (e.g. some of it is used by Starlink)
2024-01-26T02:52:07-0500	<vkrishn>	but still owned by google ?

2024-01-26T03:03:59-0500	<vkrishn>	3. send that link via whatsapp to your friend
2024-01-26T03:04:14-0500	<vkrishn>	4. watch access log of the website and see who visits it first
2024-01-26T03:07:05-0500	<somercet>	The FBI?
2024-01-26T03:07:55-0500	<vkrishn>	really, i am in india, sending txt to my indian friend

2024-01-26T03:18:34-0500	<voldial>	I had a thing: []u8, and I want a thing: [*:0]const u8, so I accessed thing.ptr and now have a thing: [*]u8, then I used @constCast(thing) and I still have a [*]u8... how to I convert []u8 to [*:0]const u8?
2024-01-26T03:21:07-0500	<f_>	hi
2024-01-26T03:28:30-0500	<zcrayfish>	``4. watch access log of the website and see who visits it first''
2024-01-26T03:28:41-0500	<zcrayfish>	Uh, obviously the crawler that does the preview frame in whatsapp.
2024-01-26T03:31:06-0500	<voldial>	os.realpath() returns []u8, how do I pass that to os.system.stat() which requires [*:0]const u8?

2024-01-26T03:34:24-0500	<vkrishn>	uhmm, i did not understand the question
2024-01-26T03:37:25-0500	<zcrayfish>	likewise.
2024-01-26T03:39:29-0500	<voldial>	https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Sentinel-Terminated-Pointers shows how to remove the sentinal... but I need to add it
2024-01-26T03:42:12-0500	<vkrishn>	u mean, crawler in-build app, note: i have not seen code of the app ?
2024-01-26T03:49:17-0500	<zcrayfish>	I don't know if the crawler is built into the app directly or not. I would assume not.
2024-01-26T03:51:36-0500	<vkrishn>	my current understanding, with secure means, any 3rd entity should not be aware of the url
2024-01-26T03:52:06-0500	<vkrishn>	maybe after visiting is once
2024-01-26T03:52:23-0500	<vkrishn>	it^
2024-01-26T03:59:06-0500	<zcrayfish>	If the site is HTTPS and the crawler doesn't save logs at all, then there's a good chance that WhatsApp doesn't know. There's just no way to know since it is closed source software.
2024-01-26T03:59:34-0500	<zcrayfish>	the fact that it has a crawler isn't indicative of anything. 
2024-01-26T04:01:41-0500	<vkrishn>	can it be said then, using whatsapp does not ensure secure messaging ?
2024-01-26T04:03:05-0500	<zcrayfish>	I don't know, I was just saying that your simple experiment proves nothing. 
2024-01-26T04:03:48-0500	<zcrayfish>	As closed-source software, we may never know. :p
2024-01-26T04:03:57-0500	<vkrishn>	well, than why google and not bing or duckduckgo ?
2024-01-26T04:04:43-0500	<zcrayfish>	I've been degoogling for a while. 
2024-01-26T04:06:43-0500	<vkrishn>	i switched to yandex more than a decade back, still need to block few more crawlers
2024-01-26T04:07:09-0500	<voldial>	ah. I had a slice, not an array. const resolved_path_null_terminated_slice = resolved_path[0..resolved_path.len :0]; worked
2024-01-26T04:07:14-0500	<vkrishn>	not saying yandex is all-heaven
2024-01-26T04:07:16-0500	<zcrayfish>	I'm using Ecosia; they mostly source from bing.
2024-01-26T04:07:26-0500	<zcrayfish>	heh, no worries there.

2024-01-26T04:09:46-0500	<vkrishn>	then, user could, iptables-restore < iptable.saved.txt , but think this might not work always
2024-01-26T04:14:53-0500	<ifreund>	voldial: you can't add a sentinel with a cast, you need to reallocate and write a null byte or whatever your sentinel is at the end
2024-01-26T04:15:56-0500	<ifreund>	all you can do with a cast is assert that a sentinel is in fact present after the memory you are referring to
2024-01-26T04:16:29-0500	<ifreund>	you may want std.men.Allocator.dupeZ()
2024-01-26T04:20:52-0500	<voldial>	ifreund: thanks, that makes sense. especially .dupeZ/.allocPrintZ. Now I'm wondering why this seems to work: https://bpa.st/2P7Q line 70 fixed the tyoe and line 71 works as expected
2024-01-26T04:21:17-0500	<voldial>	it's my first zig prog, so yea.
2024-01-26T04:24:06-0500	<ifreund>	are you sure its not passing garbage to stat() until the next 0 in memory?
2024-01-26T04:24:26-0500	<ifreund>	could use strace to check
2024-01-26T04:24:39-0500	<orbifx>	roxlu unless you can script something, from what I understand you have to write it yourself. Or use scan to find the key if you know something about it
2024-01-26T04:25:22-0500	<orbifx>	Sorry stray message
2024-01-26T04:25:37-0500	<voldial>	ifreund: yea, I think... because if I stat() a non-directory, line 79 triggers... o wait... no. hm you are prob right... strace'in.
2024-01-26T04:41:54-0500	<voldial>	yea, it's working. strace shows line 71 results in open("/some_path_that_is_supposed_to_be_a_dir_but_really_is_a_file/sha3_256", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC|O_PATH) = 3 and line 79 triggers
2024-01-26T04:43:05-0500	<voldial>	but.. I hear ya... it's not known on comptime... so those allocations for the nulls gotta be somewhere?
2024-01-26T04:45:17-0500	<ifreund>	or you can manually write the required null to your buffer
2024-01-26T04:55:42-0500	<_DOOM_>	I am trying to create on the fly structures via macros but I am running into a problem where if I use a pointer type in the macro that type gets expanded with a space. So if I try to make the structure name based on the type it won't work.
2024-01-26T04:55:52-0500	<_DOOM_>	Is there any way to get around this?
2024-01-26T05:17:08-0500	<brenwright[m]>	72 hours to recover my funds and I was amazed. Without any doubt, I highly recommend Hacker Steve for all your cryptocurrency recovery, digital funds recovery, hacking, and cybersecurity-related issues. Contact them now via hackersteve911@gmail.com

2024-01-26T19:52:28-0500	<pj[m]>	yes

2024-01-26T19:52:52-0500	<pjs>	is there a way to install another version via apk?
2024-01-26T19:53:14-0500	<pj[m]>	You could checkout aports and build it yourself
2024-01-26T19:53:31-0500	<pj[m]>	that way it would be built for current system as apk
2024-01-26T19:54:04-0500	<pjs>	pj[m]: thanks. I'll look into that
2024-01-26T19:59:11-0500	<pj>	they are multiplying
2024-01-26T20:00:49-0500	<pjs>	pj[m]: don't suppose you have a link you can point me to describing how to build one of these aports manually?

2024-01-26T20:10:25-0500	<invoked>	there's netsurf, but it's missing a lot, and it's c which for some people these days is self-immolation, i guess
2024-01-26T20:11:10-0500	<omni>	you could try distrobox, it's in community/ since a couple of years, https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox
2024-01-26T20:11:12-0500	<invoked>	if i had the time/energy/desire i might work on it, but i vehemently disagree with a lot of the web stack, in principle
2024-01-26T20:12:24-0500	<invoked>	there's no way to work on that stuff without getting in the mud.
2024-01-26T20:15:54-0500	<omni>	I use qutebrowser with qt5-qtwebengine (87-based chromium), because I feel that qt6-webengine (112-based chromium) is sometimes sluggish
2024-01-26T20:16:35-0500	<omni>	and I don't feel like I'm missing anything with 87-based chromium and the qt project backports security fixes
2024-01-26T20:18:06-0500	<omni>	I have no idea how hard it would be to rip features out and have a smaller webengine that does most of what you'd want for a simpler subset of the web
2024-01-26T20:19:02-0500	<omni>	invoked: I think you meant to say that, there's no way to work on that stuff without getting mad.
2024-01-26T20:19:32-0500	<omni>	at least that's what my brain wanted to read
2024-01-26T20:25:35-0500	<invoked>	well, i built a search engine once. so i had to deal with crawling, dom, summarizing, all of that. most of that has left my brain, it was a long time ago (going on 17 years ago). i've never been a user-facing engineer, per se
2024-01-26T20:26:14-0500	<invoked>	the prospect of learning a web browser code base, even something like netsurf, is frankly terrifying.
2024-01-26T20:27:17-0500	<invoked>	it's hard to compartmentalize when working on a web browser, i'd say
2024-01-26T20:27:20-0500	<invoked>	but i don't really know.
2024-01-26T20:27:58-0500	<invoked>	i've done some patches here and there over the years, but i was always worried about ripple effects, because a browser like firefox or chromium, are very complex.
2024-01-26T20:28:38-0500	<invoked>	so if you start turning things off, or removing things, it gets weird fast.
2024-01-26T20:29:19-0500	<invoked>	i often say the most complex software anybody will install is a browser, but then we also have electron shit.
2024-01-26T20:30:34-0500	<pjs>	omni: thanks. That's a bit overkill for my case. 
2024-01-26T20:32:27-0500	<omni>	ok =)
2024-01-26T20:32:42-0500	<omni>	it's pretty convenient, but I've actually never used it on alpine
2024-01-26T20:32:59-0500	<omni>	only on other distros to run things packaged in alpine
2024-01-26T20:33:49-0500	<pjs>	kinda neat though
2024-01-26T20:34:11-0500	<pjs>	thanks for the recommendation. I'll toy around with it in other cases if needed

2024-01-26T21:47:14-0500	<somercet>	In C, if I rest the cursor on a function name (say), and hit ctrl-n, vis will highlight the name, then every time it sees that name in the file.

2024-01-26T21:47:52-0500	<WickedSmoke>	The visual selection is very squirrelly.  And there seems to be bug where undoing an edit jumps the cursor to the top of the document.
2024-01-26T21:48:32-0500	<somercet>	what version of Vis, and what OS/distro?
2024-01-26T21:48:58-0500	<WickedSmoke>	Is there highlighting of search terms?  Is that an option?
2024-01-26T21:49:34-0500	<WickedSmoke>	vis v0.7-154-g5cd6d03 built today.
2024-01-26T21:49:34-0500	<somercet>	afaik, just the cursor.

2024-01-26T21:51:21-0500	<somercet>	it's on 0.8
2024-01-26T21:51:52-0500	<WickedSmoke>	I pulled from GitHub.
2024-01-26T21:52:19-0500	<somercet>	ah, dev moved to sourcehut

2024-01-26T21:57:06-0500	<WickedSmoke>	And there's no real difference between 0.7.1 & 0.8
2024-01-26T21:58:08-0500	<WickedSmoke>	I'll roll back and try 0.8 anyway
2024-01-26T21:59:52-0500	<Company>	mclasen: the font loading changes make font: "Monospace 10"; no longer work
2024-01-26T21:59:59-0500	<Company>	it wants the actual font now

2024-01-26T22:00:16-0500	<mclasen>	you means yours, or mine?
2024-01-26T22:00:28-0500	<WickedSmoke>	The cursor also jumps after undo with 0.8.
2024-01-26T22:01:31-0500	<mclasen>	Ah, yeah, I can see that now
2024-01-26T22:02:25-0500	<mclasen>	so we should only check the family name when we look up in the custom fontmap
2024-01-26T22:02:40-0500	<WickedSmoke>	I really like the smaller editor size, but so far there are three regressions from the Vim experience so I'm not sure I can switch over.
2024-01-26T22:02:40-0500	<mclasen>	not when using system fonts, where we want to allow fallback

2024-01-26T22:03:31-0500	<jeho>	well yeah.. if nobody knows then I'll just have to throw some tests at it and step through the code.
2024-01-26T22:03:39-0500	<WickedSmoke>	I'm doing a column cut and paste, then hit "u"
2024-01-26T22:05:23-0500	<somercet>	I don't see it. I highlighted three lines with "const gchar", after creating three empty lines above it, and cut and pasted the words without any jumping
2024-01-26T22:06:09-0500	<somercet>	ctrl-j to select three lines, '2dw', scrolled up, and 'p'
2024-01-26T22:06:52-0500	<WickedSmoke>	Columns.   (2Ctrl-j v llll x hhhh Ctrl-p u)
2024-01-26T22:07:44-0500	<somercet>	Ctrl-p would reduce the number of cursors
2024-01-26T22:07:48-0500	<somercet>	'p' pastes
2024-01-26T22:07:53-0500	<WickedSmoke>	Yes.
2024-01-26T22:08:16-0500	<somercet>	ah, I see the jump
2024-01-26T22:08:20-0500	<WickedSmoke>	When I undo the cursor needs to return to where it was on that operation.
2024-01-26T22:09:15-0500	<somercet>	yah
2024-01-26T22:10:06-0500	<somercet>	I will look at it
2024-01-26T22:11:25-0500	<WickedSmoke>	I just Ctrl-p out of (bad?) habit.  Cursor seems to move back with 'p'.
2024-01-26T22:12:43-0500	<WickedSmoke>	Wait, Ctrl-p is paste before position. So that's what I want.
2024-01-26T22:15:58-0500	<mclasen>	Company: I have a hard time writing cache tests
2024-01-26T22:17:07-0500	<mclasen>	the things I've tried so far (use of textures in multiple renderers, freeing the texture while it is in the cache) don't cause any misbehaviors
2024-01-26T22:17:56-0500	<Company>	you need to evict the texture and then use it again I think
2024-01-26T22:18:01-0500	<Company>	not free the texture
2024-01-26T22:20:04-0500	<Company>	but I'm off to bed now

2024-01-26T22:20:30-0500	<WickedSmoke>	So sorry, the command is Shift-p.  I've used vim so long the commands are hardwired into my hands and I can't even tell you what I'm doing.
2024-01-26T22:21:29-0500	<mclasen>	evicting it only works if it is in the hashtable, tho
2024-01-26T22:21:34-0500	<mclasen>	tricky
2024-01-26T22:21:57-0500	<WickedSmoke>	Anyway, so pasting a cut column before the cursor causes the jump.  You can reproduce that?

2024-01-26T22:46:37-0500	<remiliascarlet>	One question: I'm playing around with Raylib in Zig with the "raylib-zig" package. Normally, Zig would link statically by default, but when compiling a project from raylib-zig without making any changes yet, it links dynamically pointing to addresses for linux-vdso.so.1, libm.so.6, libc.so.6, and /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. Is there a way to make those link statically as well in the build.zig file?
2024-01-26T22:49:33-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I use Zig 0.11.0 by the way, because I'm cross-developing between Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and want to make sure the versions match to avoid another catastrophe I had previously with one being 0.10.1, the other being 0.11.0-dev, and yet another being 0.9.1.
2024-01-26T22:52:36-0500	<twkm>	even the o/s doesn't provide enough info, as what else it is doing and on what h/w is used will matter.

2024-01-26T23:03:50-0500	<torque>	the build.zig calls `linkSystemLibrary` for those libraries so it will link them dynamically
2024-01-26T23:06:33-0500	<torque>	Since distros probably don't have static versions of those libraries, you might have to build them manually to get static versions
2024-01-26T23:13:06-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I have static libraries installed for both libc and libm.

2024-01-26T23:41:09-0500	<d_val>	Hi I'm writing a simple server-client messaging, I have something like this `if(send(clients[j].fd, msg, strlen(msg), MSG_NOSIGNAL) == -1) WARN("Client %s quit? %s\n", clients[j].nick, strerror(errno));` I figure if strerror tell me it's a broken I can close the receiving fd, but send() somehow returned -1 and the strerror read "success"
2024-01-26T23:41:24-0500	<d_val>	I'm not sure if it a success why does send() returned -1?
2024-01-26T23:41:49-0500	<d_val>	broken pipe*
2024-01-26T23:42:22-0500	<d_val>	tl;dr send() returned -1 with errno set to 0
2024-01-26T23:44:47-0500	<twkm>	-1 isn't always an error.
2024-01-26T23:45:12-0500	<johnjaye>	i was not expecting that answer
2024-01-26T23:45:17-0500	<pekster>	That's a POSOIX API, but in both SUSv3 (2004 edition) and SUSv3 (2008 edition), "Upon successful completion, send() shall return the number of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error."
2024-01-26T23:45:47-0500	<pekster>	I don't have an offline copy of the 1995 SUSv2 API, but 1) it's likely the same, and 2) surely you're not using older than a 20-year old Unix system.
2024-01-26T23:45:52-0500	<twkm>	if it is non-blocking then the "error" might be that it would block, which isn't really an error more like a notice that you can't send now.
2024-01-26T23:46:42-0500	<d_val>	pekster, I'm on Debian 12, which is recent by Debian standard
2024-01-26T23:46:45-0500	<pekster>	That'd still set errno, to either EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK (IIRC those are the same code everywhere except something like Microsoft.)
2024-01-26T23:46:49-0500	<twkm>	..., i.e., errno == EWOULDBLOK.
2024-01-26T23:47:05-0500	<d_val>	Am I understanding this correct, on error -1 may be returned but it doesn't have to be an error for it to return -1?
2024-01-26T23:47:06-0500	<twkm>	err, yes, spelled correctly as pekster showed.
2024-01-26T23:47:14-0500	<pekster>	A well-written implementation would test on both of those, just in case they are unique codes.
2024-01-26T23:47:33-0500	<pekster>	Well written program rather (supporting any POSIX-compliant implementation.)
2024-01-26T23:47:51-0500	<twkm>	also if send was interrupted (having sent nothing) you'll get an EINTR.
2024-01-26T23:48:30-0500	<twkm>	but the -1 does indeed mean something did not go as expected.
2024-01-26T23:48:35-0500	<pekster>	Lots of reasons send() can call. ECONNRESET ("connection reset by peer" as IRC would put it) is another. Just look up send() in the POSIX docs.
2024-01-26T23:49:21-0500	<pekster>	SUSv4: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799 . Start there, click 'System Interfaces' (top-left pane) then '3. System Interfaces' (lower-left pane) and scroll down and/or search for 'send()'
2024-01-26T23:49:23-0500	<candide>	Title of pekster's link: The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition
2024-01-26T23:50:24-0500	<pekster>	And fwiw, there's also ##posix for POSIX-specific questions. #c is sometimes on-topic-ish for that too, but not all regulars are readily familiar with vendor APIs (I'd be quite worthless if you were asking about winsock APIs for your Redmond-produced platform.)
2024-01-26T23:50:51-0500	<d_val>	How can I check if it's EWOULDBLOCK with errno set to 0?
2024-01-26T23:50:59-0500	<d_val>	Or something else
2024-01-26T23:51:11-0500	<pekster>	If you get -1 form send(), a POSIX-conforming implementation is *required* to set errno.
2024-01-26T23:51:14-0500	<pekster>	from*
2024-01-26T23:52:51-0500	<d_val>	Very well, thank you pekster twkm I think I'm just going to switch to checking if the number of byte send is correct
2024-01-26T23:55:07-0500	<pekster>	Do note that errno is a global-scope extern, so it's only meaningful to check *directly* after a syscall that sets it; if you check later (when another library call could have been invoked) it may not reflect the failing call anymore.
2024-01-26T23:55:53-0500	<d_val>	Ah might be that too, my WARN macro do have fprintf inside
2024-01-26T23:55:53-0500	<pekster>	That'll bite some abstraction models, but the solution is pretty idomatic C: save errno at the failure point and pass it through any messy abstractions involved.
2024-01-26T23:56:04-0500	<d_val>	The 0 in errno must be from fprintf
2024-01-26T23:56:10-0500	<d_val>	That's so obvious now I feel stupid
2024-01-26T23:57:37-0500	<pekster>	It's easy to forget; this is why it's pretty poor form to use such globals in library code (as in: library code you write for others to use, even just yourself in other programs.)
2024-01-26T23:58:00-0500	<johnjaye>	pekster: that sounds completely unworkable with threads or concurrency.
2024-01-26T23:58:09-0500	<johnjaye>	i wonder how pthreads does it
2024-01-26T23:58:13-0500	<pekster>	errno is in Thread Local Storage.
2024-01-26T23:58:17-0500	<pekster>	(one per thread.)
2024-01-26T23:58:31-0500	<johnjaye>	ah. the thread local storage. i see.

2024-01-27T00:12:55-0500	<d_val>	So it's a double blow

2024-01-27T01:35:52-0500	<Saijin_Naib[m]>	Also, I see grub got a new r1 release. Do I need to shit myself in preparation for this, or will this be a seamless bump since we arent changing grub versions?
2024-01-27T01:46:54-0500	<FrostJacked>	Not sure if it's a zig or an llvm issue, but is it a known issue where sometimes building a (relatively small and simple) program will randomly take ages in non-debug modes?

2024-01-27T06:06:48-0500	<satmd>	LED control for RGB happens in userspace mostly and are not available during a panic
2024-01-27T06:08:54-0500	<rahl>	Arsen: damn, I can be slow. The very first command I ran on it was file. I only noted it was an ELF (at the time not realising this was the expected coredump type) and went off down a rabbit hole without payinf proper attention to the rest of file's output

2024-01-27T06:36:50-0500	<ninewise>	not sure, usually multiple lines being deleted/added outside the viewport iirc

2024-01-27T07:01:36-0500	<Company>	mclasen: random thought about the cache handling from reading the code that I did not test at all
2024-01-27T07:02:00-0500	<Company>	mclasen: if a GdkTexture is freed, how long until its associated GL texture is removed from the cache?
2024-01-27T07:02:26-0500	<mclasen>	<= GC timeout seconds

2024-01-27T07:03:18-0500	<mclasen>	you said that textures can be freed on any thread
2024-01-27T07:03:27-0500	<Company>	absolutely they can
2024-01-27T07:03:30-0500	<mclasen>	that is why the detach callback can't do anything but flip a bit
2024-01-27T07:03:44-0500	<Company>	well, it could queue an idle
2024-01-27T07:04:09-0500	<Company>	though yeah, it has no device packpointer I think
2024-01-27T07:04:16-0500	<mclasen>	yeah
2024-01-27T07:04:18-0500	<mclasen>	that is the main problem
2024-01-27T07:04:40-0500	<Company>	that kinda was on purpose, because I didn't want threads to fiddle with the device
2024-01-27T07:04:43-0500	<Company>	still
2024-01-27T07:04:53-0500	<mclasen>	I feel if we want to be threadsafe, we need a mutex
2024-01-27T07:04:54-0500	<Company>	that is kind of a problem
2024-01-27T07:04:59-0500	<mclasen>	but it sucks 
2024-01-27T07:05:10-0500	<mclasen>	since then we get locking during lookups too
2024-01-27T07:05:20-0500	<Company>	we're not doing a mutex
2024-01-27T07:05:38-0500	<mclasen>	then we have to live with stale gl textures being around for a while
2024-01-27T07:05:49-0500	<mclasen>	or do gc after each frame
2024-01-27T07:06:19-0500	<Company>	we can do an atomic counter or something like that
2024-01-27T07:06:31-0500	<b_jonas>	I'm guessing objdump can tell as well
2024-01-27T07:06:33-0500	<mclasen>	that would have to live i the device
2024-01-27T07:06:38-0500	<mclasen>	but... no backpointer
2024-01-27T07:06:43-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-01-27T07:06:56-0500	<b_jonas>	like objdump -x filename
2024-01-27T07:08:10-0500	<mclasen>	we could add a backpointer for that purpose
2024-01-27T07:08:50-0500	<mclasen>	or we could make it so that render data is sufficient and ditch the hash table
2024-01-27T07:08:59-0500	<Company>	how?
2024-01-27T07:09:20-0500	<mclasen>	have an array
2024-01-27T07:09:41-0500	<Company>	what kind of array? and where?
2024-01-27T07:09:52-0500	<mclasen>	an array of render data, I mean
2024-01-27T07:10:05-0500	<Company>	that needs to be threadsafe, too
2024-01-27T07:10:11-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, sadly
2024-01-27T07:10:27-0500	<Company>	I'd rather get rid of the render data and only use the hash table
2024-01-27T07:10:33-0500	<Company>	than add a hash table to textures
2024-01-27T07:11:01-0500	<mclasen>	you say that hash lookups aren't a problem, so maybe that is fine
2024-01-27T07:11:14-0500	<Company>	that doesn't help use here anyway
2024-01-27T07:11:28-0500	<mclasen>	it makes the situation a bit easier
2024-01-27T07:11:32-0500	<Company>	no
2024-01-27T07:11:38-0500	<mclasen>	but we'd still have to deal with the weakref
2024-01-27T07:11:50-0500	<Company>	you want to remove the hash table entry when the texture goes away in another thread
2024-01-27T07:11:59-0500	<mclasen>	I can't
2024-01-27T07:12:06-0500	<mclasen>	I can only mark the entry as invalid
2024-01-27T07:12:47-0500	<mclasen>	so it doesn't get used for lookups anymore
2024-01-27T07:12:54-0500	<Company>	I think the requirement is "get rid of the 2GB texture before allocating the next one"
2024-01-27T07:13:30-0500	<mclasen>	then you need to lock the hash table so the thread can do it
2024-01-27T07:13:37-0500	<mclasen>	or do gc at allocation time
2024-01-27T07:20:40-0500	<Company>	I think I want an atomic that counts the number of changes to the cache since the last gc
2024-01-27T07:20:50-0500	<Company>	number of changes or size of changes
2024-01-27T07:21:11-0500	<mclasen>	I assume you don't want to count every glpyh
2024-01-27T07:21:19-0500	<mclasen>	just textures
2024-01-27T07:21:46-0500	<Company>	I think I do, but I might use a non-atomic counter for that
2024-01-27T07:22:11-0500	<Company>	though I'm not sure if we need to count use() calls
2024-01-27T07:22:17-0500	<Company>	or just add/remove
2024-01-27T07:23:17-0500	<Company>	what I want to achieve is 2 things:
2024-01-27T07:23:25-0500	<mclasen>	the question is what purpose the counter is meant to serve
2024-01-27T07:23:33-0500	<Company>	1. tracking if it's even necessary to g_timeout_add() a gc run
2024-01-27T07:23:39-0500	<mclasen>	counting use() does not seems useful to me
2024-01-27T07:23:56-0500	<Company>	2. make sure to gc() very soon if the changes are big
2024-01-27T07:23:56-0500	<mclasen>	I don't think that is a very pressing problem
2024-01-27T07:24:10-0500	<Company>	I think that is a very pressing problem
2024-01-27T07:24:11-0500	<mclasen>	this is more interesting
2024-01-27T07:24:30-0500	<mclasen>	but counting changes doesn't tell you if they are big
2024-01-27T07:24:33-0500	<Company>	I don't want nautilus to gc its thumbnails every 15s while I'm playing a game
2024-01-27T07:25:00-0500	<mclasen>	I don't tihnk its a big concern
2024-01-27T07:25:06-0500	<Company>	I do
2024-01-27T07:25:15-0500	<Company>	it's a typical sign of bad code
2024-01-27T07:25:16-0500	<mclasen>	it does not cause crashes
2024-01-27T07:25:24-0500	<mclasen>	unlike our current caching code
2024-01-27T07:25:27-0500	<Company>	that it runs unnecessary timeouts all the time
2024-01-27T07:25:47-0500	<mclasen>	you did not want gc tied to frames
2024-01-27T07:25:54-0500	<Company>	I still don't
2024-01-27T07:26:21-0500	<Company>	I want gc tied to it being useful :)
2024-01-27T07:26:53-0500	<Company>	freeing a gig of memory means it's useful to run gc right now
2024-01-27T07:27:17-0500	<Company>	not doing anything means it's not useful to run gc ever
2024-01-27T07:28:56-0500	<mclasen>	you still haven't told me what you want to count, and how to do it atomically
2024-01-27T07:29:45-0500	<Company>	either number of textures freed or size of textures freed
2024-01-27T07:30:26-0500	<mclasen>	I don't think number of textures has the right information
2024-01-27T07:30:44-0500	<Company>	number of textures would just be useful for "something was freed"
2024-01-27T07:30:44-0500	<mclasen>	you basically want to do the same we do atlases now - count dead pixels
2024-01-27T07:30:56-0500	<Company>	so difference between 0 and not 0
2024-01-27T07:31:07-0500	<mclasen>	a bit would do for that
2024-01-27T07:31:16-0500	<Company>	yeah, but atomic bits aren't a thing
2024-01-27T07:31:50-0500	<Company>	g_atomic_inc_and_test()
2024-01-27T07:32:36-0500	<mclasen>	but this still doesn't address your requirement
2024-01-27T07:33:14-0500	<mclasen>	of "free 2G of dead pixels before allocating the next"
2024-01-27T07:33:36-0500	<Company>	yeah, that's why counting the total bytes could help
2024-01-27T07:33:44-0500	<mclasen>	since they will only get freed at gc time, and the next allocation can happen in the same frame
2024-01-27T07:33:48-0500	<Company>	so that render() could check
2024-01-27T07:34:03-0500	<Company>	before rendering
2024-01-27T07:34:18-0500	<Company>	"woah, there's 2GB of textures freed, lets run gc() before rendering"
2024-01-27T07:34:57-0500	<mclasen>	so now you do want gc tied to frames
2024-01-27T07:35:11-0500	<Company>	no
2024-01-27T07:35:17-0500	<Company>	but also yes
2024-01-27T07:35:27-0500	*	sonya_ is now known as sonya
2024-01-27T07:35:49-0500	<mclasen>	if that is ok with you, running maybe_gc before render solves both problems
2024-01-27T07:36:23-0500	<Company>	I want to not loop the list of glyphs every frame when nothing changed
2024-01-27T07:36:29-0500	<mclasen>	at the risk of adding some variability to render times
2024-01-27T07:36:47-0500	<mclasen>	it was your decision to stuff glyphs and textures in the same list
2024-01-27T07:37:00-0500	<Company>	because a usual frame redraws the 16x16 spinner at a slightly different rotation
2024-01-27T07:37:05-0500	<mclasen>	make separate lists, treat them separately
2024-01-27T07:37:08-0500	<Company>	no need to count if all the glyphs are still there
2024-01-27T07:37:27-0500	<mclasen>	the only time we ever need to walk the glyph list is when an atlas gets freed
2024-01-27T07:37:59-0500	<Company>	the glyphs are in the cache list, because icon textures could be treated like glyphs
2024-01-27T07:38:10-0500	<Company>	like they are in the GL renderer
2024-01-27T07:38:17-0500	<Company>	another thing that nobody has implemented yet
2024-01-27T07:38:19-0500	<mclasen>	then  you need to walk them during gc...
2024-01-27T07:38:39-0500	<Company>	yeah - I need to anyway to decide about the atlas
2024-01-27T07:39:10-0500	<Company>	my point is to not gc when not necessary
2024-01-27T07:39:47-0500	<mclasen>	we could still have separate lists of atlased items and others
2024-01-27T07:39:59-0500	<mclasen>	and maintain a dead-pixel count for the second list
2024-01-27T07:40:25-0500	<Company>	sure - but that wouldn't make the problem any different
2024-01-27T07:40:51-0500	<mclasen>	it lets you not walk glyphs when the dead-pixel count gets high
2024-01-27T07:41:01-0500	<mclasen>	but as you said, we still need to regularly walk the glyph list
2024-01-27T07:41:08-0500	<Company>	it just would go from "lots of glyphs in the cache" to "lots of thumbnails in the cache" when describing the problem
2024-01-27T07:41:32-0500	<Company>	until you put thumbnails in the atlas, then we'd need to find yet another case
2024-01-27T07:41:56-0500	<mclasen>	lets solve one problem at a time
2024-01-27T07:42:09-0500	<mclasen>	the 'need to avoid 2G of dead pixels' is a non-atlas problem
2024-01-27T07:42:17-0500	<mclasen>	since atlased items are small
2024-01-27T07:42:32-0500	<Company>	they can be numerous, but I think getting to 2GB is hard
2024-01-27T07:43:10-0500	<Company>	4kB for hidpi thumbnails, you'd need 500.000 of them
2024-01-27T07:43:11-0500	<mclasen>	so if we can walk only the list of potentially big items at the beginning of each frame, that is some progress
2024-01-27T07:43:19-0500	<Company>	actually, iconview thumbnails are larger
2024-01-27T07:43:29-0500	<Company>	how big is an iconview thumbnail?
2024-01-27T07:46:08-0500	<Company>	64x64 here - that'd be 65kB on hidpi per thumbnail, so 32768 icons to get to 2GB
2024-01-27T07:46:20-0500	<Company>	you need to scroll a very long directory to get there
2024-01-27T07:46:44-0500	<Company>	but 100s of MB should be doable in 15s
2024-01-27T07:47:31-0500	<mclasen>	assuming we count dead pixels for non-atlased items, how would we decide whats too much?
2024-01-27T07:47:32-0500	<Company>	maybe even faster if you scroll a fontchooser with text being large enough
2024-01-27T07:47:53-0500	<Company>	I would hardcode something
2024-01-27T07:48:19-0500	<Company>	ideally you'd look at GPU memory and deduce it from there
2024-01-27T07:48:52-0500	<Company>	and I know Vulkan has that info for you - including memory use of VRAM areas I think
2024-01-27T07:49:46-0500	<Company>	size, budget and usage for every memory heap (search for "memoryHeap" in vulkaninfo)
2024-01-27T07:50:10-0500	<Company>	but for the renderer, I'd probably go with something like 1MB
2024-01-27T07:50:31-0500	<Company>	if the app had enough time to free 1MB of textures, we have enough time to run the gc
2024-01-27T07:50:51-0500	<mclasen>	it might have just freed one texture
2024-01-27T07:51:30-0500	<Company>	but a big one
2024-01-27T07:51:53-0500	<Company>	I said 1MB because I was thinking the size of an atlas
2024-01-27T07:51:59-0500	<Company>	that's 1M pixels though, not 1MB
2024-01-27T07:52:04-0500	<mclasen>	yeah
2024-01-27T07:53:29-0500	<mclasen>	still not clear what to do about atlased items
2024-01-27T07:53:39-0500	<mclasen>	there's a lot of them
2024-01-27T07:54:14-0500	<mclasen>	we need to walk them at some point
2024-01-27T07:55:32-0500	<Company>	just walk them during gc
2024-01-27T07:56:34-0500	<mclasen>	at the beginning of the frame ? or do you want to do two separate things?
2024-01-27T07:56:46-0500	<Company>	whenever we do gc
2024-01-27T07:56:53-0500	<Company>	which we only do when necessary
2024-01-27T07:57:21-0500	<mclasen>	not quite clear yet
2024-01-27T07:57:40-0500	<mclasen>	if we count dead pixels for textures, we can know when it is necessary to gc textures
2024-01-27T07:58:29-0500	<Company>	I think that's the only way to handle the Sophie case
2024-01-27T07:58:46-0500	<mclasen>	but we still need a timeout to age the atlased items
2024-01-27T07:58:52-0500	<Company>	yes
2024-01-27T07:58:52-0500	<mclasen>	and I don't know when to disable that
2024-01-27T07:59:20-0500	<Company>	but the timeout is only relevant after a frame
2024-01-27T07:59:39-0500	<Company>	because that's the only place where items get added or aged
2024-01-27T08:00:04-0500	<Company>	so I'd queue a timeout (if none is queued yet) after the frame
2024-01-27T08:00:08-0500	<mclasen>	so you want me to unschedule it after gc and reinstate it after a frame?
2024-01-27T08:00:10-0500	<Company>	and have that timeout run once
2024-01-27T08:00:17-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-01-27T08:00:24-0500	<Company>	I think that makes most sense
2024-01-27T08:00:51-0500	<Company>	ideally you should only queue it on use() of a cached item but that seems overkill
2024-01-27T08:02:00-0500	<mclasen>	you could also look at the atlas count - if there's no atlas, there's nothing to age
2024-01-27T08:02:07-0500	<mclasen>	but that seems largely theoretical
2024-01-27T08:02:15-0500	<Company>	we cache textures, too
2024-01-27T08:02:27-0500	<Company>	and evict them
2024-01-27T08:02:31-0500	<Company>	or don't we?
2024-01-27T08:03:00-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, true
2024-01-27T08:04:15-0500	<Company>	is there anything we will never evict?
2024-01-27T08:04:22-0500	<Company>	I guess there is
2024-01-27T08:05:03-0500	<mclasen>	if you run with GSK_DEBUG=glyphcache, you can watch all numbers go down to 0 over time
2024-01-27T08:05:33-0500	<Company>	I thought we always keep the current atlas
2024-01-27T08:06:06-0500	<mclasen>	no, the current code drops an atlas if it contains too many dead pixels
2024-01-27T08:07:17-0500	<mclasen>	no exceptions
2024-01-27T08:09:46-0500	<Company>	well, the atlas is typically 90% empty
2024-01-27T08:10:21-0500	<mclasen>	if it is 90% empty, its dead pixels won't be close to the threshold
2024-01-27T08:10:22-0500	<Company>	like, when you run gtk-demo and leave it sitting idle, it should never drop the atlas, or?
2024-01-27T08:12:39-0500	<mclasen>	right, if I do that here, I see all 59 glyphs are old, but the atlas dead pixels ratio is 0.01
2024-01-27T08:12:47-0500	<mclasen>	so we keep it (and the glyphs)
2024-01-27T08:16:11-0500	<Company>	I was thinking about making the timeout return SOURCE_CONTINUE while there's still stuff in the cache
2024-01-27T08:16:17-0500	<Company>	but that won't work
2024-01-27T08:16:40-0500	<Company>	so I think the conclusion is:
2024-01-27T08:17:22-0500	<Company>	run GC if
2024-01-27T08:17:39-0500	<Company>	1. 15s have elapsed after a frame and no GC was run
2024-01-27T08:17:54-0500	<Company>	2. more than 1MB of cached textures have been freed
2024-01-27T08:18:11-0500	<mclasen>	you could try to do something like "keep the timout running as long as there's non-stale items"
2024-01-27T08:18:17-0500	<mclasen>	but thats maybe a bit too complicated
2024-01-27T08:18:50-0500	<Company>	yeah, I'd rather forget to evict a few items than run the callback for hours
2024-01-27T08:19:24-0500	<mclasen>	the current code never evicts any textures from the hash at all, I believe
2024-01-27T08:19:44-0500	<Company>	yeah, because we forgot that
2024-01-27T08:19:54-0500	<mclasen>	unless you manage to get an address reuse for a texture
2024-01-27T08:21:34-0500	<Company>	I think you also get it if you evict the texture
2024-01-27T08:21:38-0500	<Company>	and then reuse the texture?
2024-01-27T08:21:53-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, true
2024-01-27T08:22:01-0500	<mclasen>	but
2024-01-27T08:22:10-0500	<mclasen>	only if you manage to reuse it with the hash
2024-01-27T08:22:22-0500	<mclasen>	you always have to have a second renderer to occupy the render data
2024-01-27T08:22:28-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-01-27T08:22:37-0500	<Company>	that's why it's node-editor and inspector only
2024-01-27T08:23:11-0500	<mclasen>	the device is per-display right?
2024-01-27T08:23:16-0500	<Company>	for now, yes
2024-01-27T08:23:19-0500	<mclasen>	so it should be inspector only I think
2024-01-27T08:23:35-0500	<mclasen>	I had to force separate displays in my tests
2024-01-27T08:23:47-0500	<Company>	node-editor triggers it because there's >1 renderer
2024-01-27T08:23:47-0500	<mclasen>	to get any hash table use
2024-01-27T08:23:53-0500	<Company>	so multiple devices
2024-01-27T08:24:14-0500	<Company>	VulkanDevice, GLDevice and whatever the GL renderer names its object
2024-01-27T08:24:39-0500	<caze>	NRK: Yes, but the "library" is still considered a part of the C programming language.
2024-01-27T08:24:59-0500	<mclasen>	oh, right. its per-class per-display
2024-01-27T08:25:13-0500	<Company>	I was gonna say you can use the Cairo renderer, but that's the one not using render data
2024-01-27T08:26:00-0500	<mclasen>	oh btw. I fixed your monospace problem
2024-01-27T08:26:01-0500	<Company>	might be worth it for your testcases
2024-01-27T08:26:09-0500	<Company>	my monospace problem?
2024-01-27T08:26:15-0500	<Company>	of the rendernode font name thing?
2024-01-27T08:26:44-0500	<mclasen>	yes
2024-01-27T08:26:47-0500	<Company>	neat
2024-01-27T08:27:16-0500	<mclasen>	it turns out one of our nodeparser tests had caught this issue
2024-01-27T08:27:30-0500	<mclasen>	but instead of looking into it, I just updated the test output back then
2024-01-27T08:27:41-0500	<mclasen>	now its back to producing the same results as in 4.12
2024-01-27T08:27:49-0500	<Company>	that reminds me I wanted to make a blocky font with blocks of height 2048, and (2048 * (n - 1) / n) for n = 1... some number
2024-01-27T08:28:09-0500	<Company>	so good testsuite, bad developer? ;)
2024-01-27T08:28:27-0500	<mclasen>	yeah
2024-01-27T08:29:00-0500	<Company>	and bad reviewer I guess (unless I didn't review it)
2024-01-27T08:29:08-0500	<Company>	but I vaguely remember looking at test diifs
2024-01-27T08:29:44-0500	<mclasen>	its easy to dismiss though - its a test that checks errors - now different errors happen
2024-01-27T08:29:48-0500	<mclasen>	still errors, so ...
2024-01-27T08:30:39-0500	<Company>	oh, I remember that from when I added the failure tests
2024-01-27T08:30:43-0500	<Company>	for the font stuff
2024-01-27T08:30:46-0500	<Company>	recently
2024-01-27T08:31:08-0500	<Company>	I looked through each and every error diligently and changed the code until it gave the errors I wanted
2024-01-27T08:31:17-0500	<Company>	in my case it was just emitting too many errors
2024-01-27T08:33:16-0500	<Company>	I still wonder how to write a good test for feaneron's fractional scaling issue
2024-01-27T08:35:09-0500	<Company>	because it's something where we round() or convert to integer somewhere and do it for the clip region but not the viewport
2024-01-27T08:35:26-0500	<Company>	and no testsuite covers that
2024-01-27T08:36:02-0500	<Company>	(or we don't do it for the clip region but for the viewport)
2024-01-27T08:36:37-0500	<mclasen>	once you go from a single frame to redraw
2024-01-27T08:36:47-0500	<mclasen>	a whole new universe of possible bugs opens up
2024-01-27T08:36:57-0500	<Company>	and that then leads to us drawing a 17.5px wide rectangle as a 18px wide rectangle
2024-01-27T08:37:26-0500	<Company>	the number of bugs is actually relatively small in the renderer
2024-01-27T08:37:35-0500	<Company>	because we immediately convert everything to the pixel grid
2024-01-27T08:38:22-0500	<Company>	and then insert a the equivalnt of a transform node
2024-01-27T08:38:23-0500	<mclasen>	but so much potential for things to go wrong
2024-01-27T08:38:35-0500	<Company>	with the scale factor
2024-01-27T08:38:44-0500	<mclasen>	say, if you forget to clear the atlas when you reuse it, you could get a palimpsest like effect
2024-01-27T08:38:59-0500	<Company>	but we don't pass in the scale factor, we pass in the viewport and deduce the scale factor...
2024-01-27T08:39:18-0500	<Company>	we can't reuse the atlas
2024-01-27T08:39:30-0500	<Company>	I realized that recently
2024-01-27T08:40:01-0500	<Company>	once you've evicted an item, that item might still be in use on the gpu
2024-01-27T08:40:35-0500	<Company>	so if you start overdrawing it, the GPU might render the wrong things in the previous frame
2024-01-27T08:42:06-0500	<Company>	in Vulkan, you could handle it by never doing straight uploads and always doing memory barriers and uploads via buffer
2024-01-27T08:42:13-0500	<Company>	and GL might handle it automatically
2024-01-27T08:42:18-0500	<Company>	but currently we don't do that
2024-01-27T08:43:11-0500	<Company>	I was thinking about that in the context of using an atlas for offscreens
2024-01-27T08:43:22-0500	<Company>	and reusing that
2024-01-27T08:43:30-0500	<Company>	to avoid allocating new offscreens every frame
2024-01-27T08:50:04-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, I thought we'd need syncs there
2024-01-27T08:50:32-0500	<mclasen>	but yeah, reuse is complicated. better to just toss the atlas
2024-01-27T08:54:25-0500	<mclasen>	hmpf 
2024-01-27T08:54:44-0500	<mclasen>	if we make the dead pixel counter atomic, it will be an int
2024-01-27T08:55:16-0500	<mclasen>	so maybe count with kb granularity ?
2024-01-27T08:55:21-0500	<Company>	oh, i cheked that
2024-01-27T08:55:24-0500	<Company>	make it a pointer
2024-01-27T08:55:31-0500	<mclasen>	hmm
2024-01-27T08:55:33-0500	<Company>	the atomic "pointer" is a gsize API
2024-01-27T08:56:04-0500	<mclasen>	fun, there's even a g_atomic_pointer_add
2024-01-27T08:57:17-0500	<mclasen>	next problem - if the texture dies, it is too late to calculate how many pixels just died
2024-01-27T08:57:32-0500	<mclasen>	I guess the image has that too
2024-01-27T09:04:48-0500	<MangoMan>	So one of the C23 proposals that got accepted was to make some stdlib functions like strchr() qualifier-preserving, and the proposal used some example macros (https://paste.thomasvoss.com/432) to show how they could be implemented.  The macros used can check if a passed pointer is const or not, but I was wondering if itâs possible to check if a double-pointer is const?  It would be nice if I could
2024-01-27T09:04:54-0500	<MangoMan>	differenciate between âchar **âÂ and âconst char **â, but Iâm struggling to make any macro that works
2024-01-27T09:14:52-0500	<rustyaxe>	so far i'm enjoying gtk :o https://imgur.com/qwapRrX.png

2024-01-27T09:17:48-0500	<hajonnes>	I was trying to assign the return of a relation to a bool but I could not get it to work. Is it possible? bool = ((sign = n) < 0)
2024-01-27T09:18:58-0500	<hajonnes>	sorry bool one = ((sign = n) < 0);
2024-01-27T09:20:00-0500	<hajonnes>	perhaps it works...
2024-01-27T09:20:18-0500	<killpid>	fine works? alrigth
2024-01-27T09:20:22-0500	<MangoMan>	hajonnes: Thereâs no reason why that shouldnât work.  It works for me
2024-01-27T09:21:07-0500	<hajonnes>	:) yes I think it does. I did a typo and got the linting to react.

2024-01-27T10:17:37-0500	<DPA>	Note, that _Generic doesn't care about if a type is const or not, so char* and char*const are both treated as char*, in fact, char*const would never match, but "const char*" is a different type to "char*" entirely, so the const is respected there.

2024-01-27T10:20:30-0500	<DPA>	I mean, it is still part of the type, it's just that _Generic normalizes that away.
2024-01-27T10:20:38-0500	<Cindy>	metaprogramming
2024-01-27T10:20:39-0500	<kurahaupo>	Cindy: that depends on why
2024-01-27T10:21:01-0500	<Cindy>	it's for bindings
2024-01-27T10:21:13-0500	<kurahaupo>	DPA: it's not part of the type of an R-value
2024-01-27T10:21:59-0500	<kurahaupo>	(at least, not in a way that's meaningful anywhere)
2024-01-27T10:22:40-0500	<DPA>	rvalue and lvalue are yet another thing entirely, they are unrelated to this.
2024-01-27T10:24:13-0500	<Company>	There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors.

2024-01-27T10:25:24-0500	<Ruin4>	Cindy: I think code generation is smart, I've used out of the box, built my own, I think it's great.
2024-01-27T10:26:04-0500	<Company>	And wanting that fixed sind ja gleich 3 WÃ¼nsche auf einmal. Das geht nun wirklich nicht.
2024-01-27T10:26:40-0500	<Ruin4>	Using it to generate binding functions is smart. If you're building it and other developers will be using it, spend a little extra time on error messages. Handling user error.
2024-01-27T10:27:19-0500	*	Company out running now

2024-01-27T10:34:34-0500	<rahl>	cheers. I still need a better grasp of objdump in general
2024-01-27T10:36:47-0500	<kurahaupo>	DPA: I mean rvalue as a shorthand for "expression rather than object", and "&p" is clearly not an object
2024-01-27T10:43:41-0500	<mclasen>	Company: sadly, I've concluded that I see zero difference in your gif
2024-01-27T10:45:02-0500	<Company>	hehe
2024-01-27T10:46:08-0500	<Company>	one of the two stutters a bit when growing/shrinking
2024-01-27T10:46:53-0500	<Company>	the black inside circle wobbles most for me
2024-01-27T10:48:18-0500	<Company>	if you use https://i.imgur.com/m26hvt6.mp4 and slow it down to 0.5 speed you can see it better
2024-01-27T10:49:55-0500	<mclasen>	nope, can't see anything
2024-01-27T10:52:37-0500	<Company>	looks like https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/5755#note_1731400, just harder to see because it's not zoomed in like madness and slowed down
2024-01-27T10:52:54-0500	<Company>	though I guess we could just try to reproduce that transition exactly
2024-01-27T10:53:53-0500	<Company>	that animation has the extra bug of clipping the outside circle though because it's mathing wrong
2024-01-27T10:54:06-0500	<Company>	and that's probably more visible even there
2024-01-27T10:54:37-0500	<Company>	it's one of those subtle half-a-pixel things
2024-01-27T10:55:07-0500	<Company>	like that feaneron bug, that I will probably be unable to quickly debug on my way-too-good monitor :/
2024-01-27T10:55:46-0500	<mclasen>	the point is, the illustration in the blog post should not be super-subtle, but rather exaggerate the difference
2024-01-27T10:55:53-0500	<mclasen>	so people like me can actually see it
2024-01-27T10:56:03-0500	<Company>	I'm aware what the goal is
2024-01-27T10:56:32-0500	<Company>	but you can't generate that with a rendernode unless you use 1px wide lines
2024-01-27T10:56:45-0500	<Company>	which is an artificial testcase
2024-01-27T10:56:53-0500	<Company>	or you zoom in like mad
2024-01-27T10:57:08-0500	*	feaneron votes for zooming in like mad
2024-01-27T10:57:11-0500	<Company>	and even then it's mostly "so what?"
2024-01-27T10:57:15-0500	<mclasen>	whats wrong with that?
2024-01-27T10:57:38-0500	<Company>	why would anyone care about something that's invisible to them?
2024-01-27T10:57:52-0500	<mclasen>	exactly!
2024-01-27T10:58:07-0500	<feaneron>	it's like ants
2024-01-27T10:58:24-0500	<feaneron>	they're barely noticeable, but they can hurt
2024-01-27T10:58:48-0500	<feaneron>	and this blog post highlights these ants, i suppose? :)
2024-01-27T10:59:41-0500	<Company>	nobody gets how ants can hurt unless they've been hurt by ants before

2024-01-27T11:02:40-0500	<mclasen>	I might use that as 'devious node' example
2024-01-27T11:02:58-0500	<Company>	might be worth playing with the numbers a bit
2024-01-27T11:03:06-0500	<Company>	like using 6.25 or so
2024-01-27T11:03:16-0500	<Company>	also widths: 1.25 etc
2024-01-27T11:03:25-0500	<Company>	notice that Cairo gets that wrong, too
2024-01-27T11:04:48-0500	<Company>	the evil part there is how to deal with the offscreen
2024-01-27T11:05:12-0500	<Company>	do you generate a 5x5 offscreen? And if so, how do you draw into it without going blurry?
2024-01-27T11:05:42-0500	<Company>	and then, when you blit it with an offset, how do you avoid blurriness there?
2024-01-27T11:06:09-0500	<Company>	NGL is pretty good in the sidebar
2024-01-27T11:06:18-0500	<Company>	but has seams on my 200% display
2024-01-27T11:07:57-0500	<Company>	and feaneron is probably looking at this and going "it's all blurry, I don't understand why any renderer should be better" because if you scale everything by 125% - oh god
2024-01-27T11:08:21-0500	<feaneron>	150% here
2024-01-27T11:08:32-0500	<Company>	oh, I thought 125%
2024-01-27T11:08:42-0500	<feaneron>	my eyes, man, they're not the same
2024-01-27T11:08:45-0500	<Company>	if you really want to screw with GL, use line widths < 1.0 - like 0.5
2024-01-27T11:09:16-0500	<Company>	lul ya
2024-01-27T11:09:32-0500	<Company>	adding "widths: 0.5;" to my test makes GL abandon all hope

2024-01-27T12:16:41-0500	<minimal>	I'm working on "step 2" which will be for new installs only - to have setup-disk create a /etc/grub-autoinstall for future use
2024-01-27T12:17:38-0500	<minimal>	I guess "step 3" will be to somehow get people with existing install to create their own such script.......nothing has been discussed so far as to how to deal with this
2024-01-27T12:19:33-0500	<minimal>	"step 3" will also have to include somehow making people who have done new install (where "step 2" is in place and so created that script) that if they change anything related to how their system boots that they will then need to modify that script accordingly or risk future runs that could break their system
2024-01-27T12:19:56-0500	<minimal>	s/making people/making people aware/
2024-01-27T12:20:01-0500	<ikke>	For step 3 I think the only thing we can do is provide instructions on how to do it
2024-01-27T12:20:17-0500	<ikke>	If you have a custom setup, you kind of assume responsibility of keeping it up-to-date / working

2024-01-27T12:21:25-0500	<ikke>	Im not saying detailed instructions 
2024-01-27T12:21:57-0500	<ikke>	But more like you said, make people aware it exists and how to use it 
2024-01-27T12:21:59-0500	<minimal>	including such things as someone deciding to switch to another bootloader but who doesn't uninstall grub ;-)
2024-01-27T12:22:36-0500	<invoked>	tbh i've considered it, for the one laptop that runs it
2024-01-27T12:24:14-0500	<minimal>	invoked: my point was specifically the bit about "doesn't uninstall grub"....in which case upon next Grub package update if that script is present it could "do what it is designed to do" and overwrite the other bootloader's stuff...doh!
2024-01-27T12:25:28-0500	<invoked>	yeah. grub isn't adding any value in my case, not anything i want, so ideally it'd just be gone
2024-01-27T12:25:46-0500	<ikke>	minimal: if they uninstall grub, the script should no longer be executed, right?
2024-01-27T12:25:57-0500	<minimal>	this grub script idea so course doesn't deal with similar issues in other bootloader packages (like syslinux)
2024-01-27T12:26:15-0500	<ikke>	absolutely
2024-01-27T12:26:16-0500	<minimal>	ikke: yes, my point was if they switch bootloader but DO NOT uninstall Grub
2024-01-27T12:26:24-0500	<ikke>	It's impossible to get every situation right
2024-01-27T12:27:27-0500	<minimal>	invoked: assuming you're EFI booting then the "value" that Grub is adding is that it is the "officially supported" (i.e. by setup-disk) Alpine bootloader for UEFI
2024-01-27T12:28:01-0500	<minimal>	ikke: yupe but that won't stop people complaining in their particular scenario...
2024-01-27T12:28:22-0500	<ikke>	people will complain if we do nothing, people will complain if we do something
2024-01-27T12:28:38-0500	<minimal>	ikke: stop complaining! ;-)
2024-01-27T12:29:32-0500	<minimal>	and yes I'm complaining that you're complaining lol
2024-01-27T12:30:53-0500	<ikke>	and I'm not even complaining :p
2024-01-27T12:31:19-0500	<ikke>	Just trying to be pragmatic
2024-01-27T12:31:24-0500	<minimal>	you're complaining that I wrongly accused you of complaining? lol
2024-01-27T12:33:56-0500	<ikke>	minimal: break; # trying to avoid a recursive infinite loop
2024-01-27T12:34:11-0500	<invoked>	minimal: i don't use the setup-* tools anyway (someday, perhaps... as the early onset dementia stops being 'early')
2024-01-27T12:34:29-0500	<ikke>	invoked: oof, sad to hear
2024-01-27T12:34:46-0500	<invoked>	ikke: i'm joking, but i have dealt with real dementia in our parents.
2024-01-27T12:34:58-0500	<Saijin_Naib[m]>	<minimal> ""step 3" will also have to..." <- Sounds great, thanks for tackling this
2024-01-27T12:35:02-0500	<invoked>	but anyway i'd need someone to tell me i have dementia, you can't self-diagnose...
2024-01-27T12:36:41-0500	<invoked>	ikke: i had a period of amnesia due to a concussion, that was bad enough. i was at a keyboard and couldn't remember any passwords.
2024-01-27T12:38:08-0500	<minimal>	invoked: neither do I, I create disk images and use those
2024-01-27T12:39:37-0500	*	Chewy64_ is now known as Chewy64
2024-01-27T12:39:59-0500	<minimal>	invoked: don't you (a) have a password manager? and/or (b) write down at least the password manager password in store in a "secure" place?
2024-01-27T12:40:36-0500	<ikke>	minimal: You'd have to remember the password for the password manager or where you stored them
2024-01-27T12:40:51-0500	<invoked>	exactly. i was trying to figure out a succinct way to say that
2024-01-27T12:41:36-0500	<invoked>	i do have a fire engine red folder now for that occasion, just for my wife's sake. legacy planning
2024-01-27T12:42:03-0500	<minimal>	"where you stored them" - well if it is a secure place then its location shouldn't be relying just on it being a secret so it would be ok to have notes etc as to where it is
2024-01-27T12:43:54-0500	<invoked>	it's hard to explain amnesia. it's everything. you don't know what day it is.
2024-01-27T12:44:13-0500	<invoked>	you might not even remember you have a password manager.
2024-01-27T12:44:53-0500	<invoked>	it's this constant feeling like you should know something but you can't even name what it is you're forgetting.
2024-01-27T12:49:32-0500	<somercet>	your supernode gets scrambled...

2024-01-27T22:59:27-0500	<hammond>	pragma-: can't find it. Well idk I looked at some, and C/C++ have a larger number of contributors. idk why though, I checked python too, it's comparable but nothing as large.
2024-01-27T22:59:37-0500	<hammond>	I might be mistaken though...
2024-01-27T23:00:03-0500	<pragma->	certainly that depends on which projects you're looking at

2024-01-27T23:26:06-0500	<remiliascarlet>	andrewrk: The one problem with that is that libc versions tend to differ between Linux distro's and systemd distro's. It's sad, but if that's the limitation of Linux, so be it then.
2024-01-27T23:27:00-0500	<remiliascarlet>	And then there's distro's that use musl instead of libc. I guess I'll need to compile the same binary on a billion different distro's then...
2024-01-27T23:46:10-0500	<somercet>	remiliascarlet, How much difference between distros between just glibc Linux and systemd Linux?
2024-01-27T23:50:31-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I used "Linux vs SystemD" more satiracle here. But the difference in versions typically cause problems. I remember how a decade ago I would compile a GTK+ program on Arch, and it would run fine on Arch, but not on Ubuntu, then you compile on Ubuntu, and it won't work on Fedora. And it was GTK+ 2.6.whatever, identical versions across them all, because GTK 3 was the more recent version at the time.
2024-01-27T23:51:05-0500	<remiliascarlet>	So that's what made me dispise dynamic linking.

2024-01-27T23:53:48-0500	<remiliascarlet>	And whenever I compile a Go binary or a Zig library (given no C API's were used), I can run the same binary perfectly fine regardless of distro.
2024-01-28T00:00:13-0500	<cryptonector>	re: isctty() you can use ttyname()/ttyname_r() (POSIX) to get the device name, and then you can stat() that device name then compare to the fstat() of some FD to tell if that FD is the controlling tty
2024-01-28T00:04:28-0500	<somercet>	ah

2024-01-28T01:41:31-0500	<constxqt>	so why doesn't it show me where in `call` this memcpy is happening
2024-01-28T01:42:19-0500	<constxqt>	also when i run nm(1) on my program, `call` is nowhere to be found

2024-01-28T07:26:18-0500	<nuxil>	Cindy, sure there are alternatives. like. you can use C++ instead of C. but is that a "better" alternative. there are many "tools" that does the same job.
2024-01-28T07:26:46-0500	<Cindy>	C++ is a tool like C
2024-01-28T07:26:59-0500	<nuxil>	heh. :D
2024-01-28T07:26:59-0500	<orbifx>	lv8pv, some languages will eventually cap you
2024-01-28T07:27:07-0500	<lv8pv>	i know some perl and some python. Have C books from 20 years back that have only had some use every 5 year or so. I really have always wanted to learn c
2024-01-28T07:27:20-0500	<Cindy>	C can do stuff that would end up with a bloated filesize if you used C++ instead
2024-01-28T07:27:54-0500	<nuxil>	i woudnt know. i dont do C++
2024-01-28T07:29:21-0500	<Cindy>	if you use C++'s STL, expect your executable to be several megabytes bigger instantly
2024-01-28T07:32:15-0500	<lv8pv>	What I find hard about starting to learn C, is to come up with a good beginner project that will trigger me to learn. Like for Perl it was text parsing and perl-cgi. For Python it was web-crawlers.
2024-01-28T07:32:57-0500	<nuxil>	take your old scripts and write them in C :P
2024-01-28T07:33:14-0500	<fettuccine>	writing unix utilities was a fun exercise for me

2024-01-28T07:37:02-0500	<fettuccine>	lv8pv: openbsd for the w
2024-01-28T07:37:28-0500	<lv8pv>	fettuccine: my TrueNAS is bsd based I think. But never used BSD for worksation
2024-01-28T07:39:04-0500	<fettuccine>	lv8pv: niice. its good but sacrifices on performance for security. lacking on virtualization too. can only virtualize linux or somth
2024-01-28T07:39:25-0500	<fettuccine>	the docs and system are rlly coherent and clean tho
2024-01-28T07:40:18-0500	<lv8pv>	Those are the things i really love with slackware. I feels like a distro you can understand and manage.
2024-01-28T07:40:31-0500	<lv8pv>	s/I/it
2024-01-28T07:41:18-0500	<lv8pv>	It does what you ask of it and no more
2024-01-28T07:42:58-0500	<fettuccine>	i should try it sometime. lotsa ppl say its nice to work with
2024-01-28T07:43:48-0500	<PabloCorreaGomez[m]>	BTW, anybody from the alpine community coming to FOSDEM or organizing anything alpine-related?
2024-01-28T07:47:26-0500	<ikke>	I have not heard anything
2024-01-28T07:48:00-0500	<PabloCorreaGomez[m]>	But might any of you be there? Even if it's just for hanging out and some beer/soda one evening?
2024-01-28T07:48:32-0500	<lv8pv>	fettuccine: you should at least try it =) ##slackware is a good place to get some help if you ever do
2024-01-28T07:50:13-0500	<slidercrank>	but it lacks a good package manager that can resolve dependencies and install them
2024-01-28T07:50:47-0500	<slidercrank>	but that's becoming offtopic
2024-01-28T07:51:24-0500	<slidercrank>	ah, we're on ##c. Offtopic is more tolerated than on the C++ channel :)
2024-01-28T07:52:28-0500	<lv8pv>	slidercrank: it dont
2024-01-28T07:52:41-0500	<lv8pv>	there are several you can install that will do that for you
2024-01-28T07:53:09-0500	<lv8pv>	but it don't ship with it from the start.
2024-01-28T07:53:30-0500	<lv8pv>	sboinstall, slpkg are two

2024-01-28T07:55:21-0500	<fettuccine>	lv8pv: alrighty
2024-01-28T07:57:34-0500	<lv8pv>	slackware it self are expecting you to install app packages. And therefor there are really no dependencies to think of. Only when you install packages from other repos, dependencies becomes a thing. And those have package managers for you to use. Like those two I mention. where slpkg manage many repos at once =) //end off topic - Sorry =)

2024-01-28T07:59:31-0500	<APic>	But we go off-Topic now
2024-01-28T08:01:16-0500	<daurnimator>	remiliascarlet: glibc is forwards compatible. i.e. you need to compile against the oldest glibc you want to allow end users to have. zig supports this as a target: `-target x86_64-linux-glibc2.25` IIRC
2024-01-28T08:02:56-0500	<daurnimator>	such a glibc target version would work on glibc 2.25 and up; i.e. such a binary would work fine a system running glibc 2.32
2024-01-28T08:05:14-0500	<bubuche87>	(I tried to transpile the code generated by bison (which is in C) to zig, using the translate-c option, but it fails because the generated C contains gotos. I am trying to find a solution online)
2024-01-28T08:06:45-0500	<bubuche87>	(I didn't find an option for bison to have it generate code that wouldn't use gotos. So now I try to find a way to have zig accepting gotos)
2024-01-28T08:16:42-0500	<mclasen>	Company: do the cache fixes look ok now ?
2024-01-28T08:18:47-0500	<ProPuke>	I'm specifically using gtk3, but I assume the functionality is the same in 3 & 4
2024-01-28T08:18:47-0500	<ProPuke>	The docs say "The maximum content width/height of scrolled_window" but setting these values doesn't seem to have any affect on the content area. If the child control is wider/taller the max content width/height, I can still scroll it in full. What does it actually limit?
2024-01-28T08:18:47-0500	<ProPuke>	ahoy all. I have what seems like an obvious question: What does GtkScrollWindow max_content_width/height do?
2024-01-28T08:19:28-0500	*	kurahaupo_ is now known as kurahaupo
2024-01-28T08:21:59-0500	<Company>	ProPuke: I think it sets the maximum size that the scrolled window will request for the content area
2024-01-28T08:22:59-0500	<Company>	which means that when you initially open your app, that's the size it'll try to request (which on GTK3 pretty much everyone overrides with gtk_window_set_default_size())
2024-01-28T08:23:35-0500	<ProPuke>	so the scrolledwindow requests size based on its child control? (but no more than the max)
2024-01-28T08:23:46-0500	<Company>	it's also used when you have a GtkPaned with a sidebar to decide how much size to give the sidebar
2024-01-28T08:23:50-0500	<Company>	things like that
2024-01-28T08:24:19-0500	<Company>	I think the scrolledwindow by default tries to make the child visible without scrolling
2024-01-28T08:24:19-0500	<remiliascarlet>	daurnimator: Alright, good to know.
2024-01-28T08:24:58-0500	<ProPuke>	hmm.. I'm not seeing it doing though, although this could be user error on my part somewhere
2024-01-28T08:25:01-0500	<Company>	which means if you have a list with 2 items, it'll request a rather small size
2024-01-28T08:25:03-0500	<ProPuke>	*doing that
2024-01-28T08:25:19-0500	<Company>	and if you have a list with 5000 items, it's gonna requests to be rather big
2024-01-28T08:25:54-0500	<lavaball>	what does the arrow actually mean? like here: wg_peer->p_flags |= WG_PEER_HAS_PUBLIC;
2024-01-28T08:27:05-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Time to dig up my Debian installation floppies from 1993.

2024-01-28T08:30:22-0500	<pragma->	bit weird that you've read "elements of c style" without knowing c
2024-01-28T08:31:50-0500	<pragma->	bit like reading algebra without knowing arithmetic innit

2024-01-28T08:32:40-0500	<TheMilkMan>	can someone explain why this outputs "5142" and isnt working? https://dpaste.org/PkdAY
2024-01-28T08:32:43-0500	<lavaball>	nah, he's still upset with me. i disagreed with his religion.
2024-01-28T08:34:02-0500	<pragma->	your swap function has no external behavior
2024-01-28T08:34:19-0500	<pragma->	it has no effect on anything
2024-01-28T08:34:44-0500	<ProPuke>	I have a scrolledwindow with a max content height of 300, a treeview inside of it with 50 items (so much taller than 300), but the scrolledwindow only appears 64 pixels tall by default :( It doesn't seem to automatically request any kind of sensibel size :/
2024-01-28T08:34:44-0500	<guest_>	i
2024-01-28T08:35:00-0500	<lavaball>	it's struct business! easy peasy then.
2024-01-28T08:35:13-0500	<TheMilkMan>	pragma- how would I got about fixingit?
2024-01-28T08:35:44-0500	<pragma->	try printing the values of things to see if things are behaving as you expect. aka debugging.
2024-01-28T08:36:25-0500	<pragma->	TheMilkMan: to fix it, learn about pointers
2024-01-28T08:36:29-0500	<mclasen>	yes, looking at the code, the max sizes limit how much the scrolledwindow requests
2024-01-28T08:36:52-0500	<mclasen>	of course, parent containers can and will make it larger anyway
2024-01-28T08:36:58-0500	<mclasen>	so the effect is not that obvious
2024-01-28T08:37:00-0500	<ProPuke>	ahh! I needed to set_propagate_natural_height! it's false by default
2024-01-28T08:37:18-0500	<TheMilkMan>	`*`Â  is value at an address and `&` is the memory address right?
2024-01-28T08:37:58-0500	<ProPuke>	everything functions as you say, then, Company. Cheers!
2024-01-28T08:38:13-0500	<lavaball>	i can confirm.
2024-01-28T08:39:09-0500	<ProPuke>	cheers mclasen. It all makes sense now
2024-01-28T08:39:13-0500	<pragma->	there's more to it
2024-01-28T08:39:39-0500	<TheMilkMan>	can you say what more there is to it? I didnt think there was more
2024-01-28T08:39:41-0500	<mclasen>	Not sure it all makes sense, but good that it works :)
2024-01-28T08:39:48-0500	<ProPuke>	hah
2024-01-28T08:39:48-0500	<mclasen>	At some point we should start over on scrolling
2024-01-28T08:39:49-0500	<lavaball>	though arrays are passed via pointer, so just give swap the array.
2024-01-28T08:41:22-0500	<pragma->	you should sit down and read a few chapters in ypur c book about how pointers work and their nuances instead of trying to cobble together a program using barely-understood concepts. c isn't friendly to learning by example.
2024-01-28T08:42:04-0500	<lavaball>	that i can't confirm. well, i guess it expects on who does the learning.
2024-01-28T08:42:13-0500	<lavaball>	depends!
2024-01-28T08:42:15-0500	<lavaball>	not expects.

2024-01-28T08:44:40-0500	<daurnimator>	remiliascarlet: huh?
2024-01-28T08:44:55-0500	<daurnimator>	remiliascarlet: every zig installation includes every version of glibc
2024-01-28T08:45:03-0500	<daurnimator>	so you don't need to go find an old distro
2024-01-28T08:45:04-0500	<ProPuke>	this is actually the behaviour I was trying to get to, so glad I don't have to do any nasty hacks to achieve it
2024-01-28T08:47:48-0500	<lavaball>	always knew i was magic. now i do the casting!
2024-01-28T08:51:05-0500	<mclasen>	Company: do you think the cache debug var is worth keeping?
2024-01-28T08:57:03-0500	<Company>	mclasen: the ability to say "never cache anything" and "never gc anything" seems quite useful
2024-01-28T08:57:17-0500	<mclasen>	I'll keep it and document it, then
2024-01-28T08:57:20-0500	<Company>	for debugging certain situations
2024-01-28T08:57:36-0500	<Company>	setting the timeout less so, although that's useful for debugging too I guess
2024-01-28T08:57:48-0500	<Company>	when you want to not gc immediately but you're debugging a gc issues
2024-01-28T08:57:56-0500	<Company>	so you can set it to like 1s or 5s
2024-01-28T08:58:17-0500	<mclasen>	makes sense
2024-01-28T08:59:15-0500	<Company>	mclasen: about the dmabuf formats, I really think we should just have surface::dmabuf-formats, because that covers all use cases
2024-01-28T08:59:34-0500	<zcrayfish>	sewn: https://mirrors.alpinelinux.org/
2024-01-28T08:59:44-0500	<mclasen>	the formats we need come from the subsurface
2024-01-28T08:59:49-0500	<mclasen>	and there can be multiple
2024-01-28T08:59:50-0500	<Company>	that's fine though
2024-01-28T08:59:53-0500	<sewn>	that doesnt answer my question
2024-01-28T09:00:12-0500	<ikke>	zcrayfish: sewn refers to https://mirrors.alpinelinux.org/mirrors.txt
2024-01-28T09:00:14-0500	<sewn>	the mirror list chooses https instead of http for all services, even if available
2024-01-28T09:00:17-0500	<Company>	we can just decide on the Wayland surface layer which ones are the right ones
2024-01-28T09:00:19-0500	<mclasen>	and I can be mean and make my surface stretch over all your monitors and put a subsurface fullscreen on each one
2024-01-28T09:00:41-0500	<zcrayfish>	right.
2024-01-28T09:00:43-0500	<mclasen>	now maybe thats a 'don't do that' situation, but you like absurdities
2024-01-28T09:00:48-0500	<Company>	yeah, and then I'll blink a warning about that on top
2024-01-28T09:01:16-0500	<luna>	seems the Bahnhof mirror list is out of date should i report it to them or to you?
2024-01-28T09:01:19-0500	<Company>	I think that's not a useful use case to have
2024-01-28T09:01:24-0500	<Company>	and afaik so far GStreamer isn't even able to reconfigure at runtime
2024-01-28T09:01:42-0500	<Company>	so you need to decide which surface you're gonna maximize on when stating to play the video
2024-01-28T09:01:52-0500	<Company>	*which monitor
2024-01-28T09:02:26-0500	<Company>	and you need to convince the compositor to give you the direct scanout config
2024-01-28T09:02:30-0500	<Company>	before maximizing
2024-01-28T09:02:58-0500	<Company>	and once those 2 things work, we can think about per-frame reconfiguring
2024-01-28T09:02:59-0500	<ikke>	luna: out of date in what sense?
2024-01-28T09:03:25-0500	<ikke>	You mean mirrors.txt on their mirror?
2024-01-28T09:03:51-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I was just joking.
2024-01-28T09:03:53-0500	<luna>	ikke: could not install sudo from it when i had them set on my Pi 4, but yeah should check to make sure
2024-01-28T09:04:31-0500	<mclasen>	but we should make an api that can at least in theory do the right thing for reconfiguring
2024-01-28T09:05:18-0500	<mclasen>	even if you keep the dmabufs on the surface, you still need to funnel them through the mediastream api
2024-01-28T09:05:24-0500	<Company>	that means exposing subsurfaces *and* letting the apps know in advance how the subsurfaces are going to be stacked
2024-01-28T09:05:43-0500	<mclasen>	I was avoiding that by adding GtkGraphicsOffload::dmabuf-formats
2024-01-28T09:05:50-0500	<mclasen>	so the subsurface can remain behind the scenes
2024-01-28T09:06:21-0500	<lavaball>	so is it good practice to always do a check before or after the casting or should i trust that the stuff i wrote fits the type?
2024-01-28T09:06:35-0500	<ikke>	http://mirror.bahnhof.net/pub/alpinelinux/v3.19/community/aarch64/sudo-1.9.15_p2-r0.apk
2024-01-28T09:06:39-0500	<Company>	but that makes the graphicsoffload the subsurface standin
2024-01-28T09:06:47-0500	<luna>	odd let me try again
2024-01-28T09:06:56-0500	<mclasen>	isn't it already ?
2024-01-28T09:07:01-0500	<Company>	no
2024-01-28T09:07:12-0500	<luna>	ah i had forgotten to enable community
2024-01-28T09:07:14-0500	<Company>	because we need no subsurface standin
2024-01-28T09:07:14-0500	<artok>	you have enabled community ? doas
2024-01-28T09:07:23-0500	<Company>	so you can use the surface
2024-01-28T09:07:40-0500	<artok>	heh.. doas servers also well
2024-01-28T09:07:57-0500	<mclasen>	so how is the gstreamer backend going find those formats if you don't put them on the mediastream?
2024-01-28T09:08:10-0500	<Company>	the mediastream has the surface already
2024-01-28T09:08:12-0500	<luna>	well i am used to sudo and don't want to learn something new
2024-01-28T09:08:22-0500	<Xgc>	TheMilkMan: Do you understand that C passes arguments to functions by making copies for functions to use.  This is called "pass by value".  So the function isn't operating on the objects passed, but copies of them.
2024-01-28T09:08:31-0500	<zcrayfish>	Isn't there a shim to convert sudo commands to doas?
2024-01-28T09:08:35-0500	<ikke>	yes
2024-01-28T09:08:49-0500	<ikke>	doas-sudo-shim
2024-01-28T09:08:58-0500	<zcrayfish>	yeah, that's the one!
2024-01-28T09:09:04-0500	<mclasen>	I don't see that
2024-01-28T09:09:10-0500	<Xgc>	TheMilkMan: That's why the swap is just swapping the copies, and the caller sees no change.
2024-01-28T09:09:12-0500	<ikke>	But mostly to convert things like sudo -i to doas -s
2024-01-28T09:09:14-0500	<Company>	::realize()
2024-01-28T09:09:21-0500	<Company>	it's where the GL context comes from
2024-01-28T09:09:25-0500	<luna>	yep that worked it was me that was stupid that had forgotten to enable the community repos thanks
2024-01-28T09:09:35-0500	<mclasen>	ah
2024-01-28T09:09:36-0500	<Company>	because mediastreams are from a time when GL contexts were per-surface
2024-01-28T09:09:42-0500	<Company>	and not per-display yet
2024-01-28T09:09:51-0500	<mclasen>	meh, well ok
2024-01-28T09:10:00-0500	<mclasen>	somebody else can reshuffle all that code
2024-01-28T09:10:07-0500	<mclasen>	at least the wayland hookup can be reused
2024-01-28T09:11:53-0500	<Company>	the things I think may be necessary and useful to have in our dmabuf code:
2024-01-28T09:12:28-0500	<Company>	1. GdkDmabufFormats tranches/flags, ie some way to put priorities in there
2024-01-28T09:12:33-0500	<luna>	all sorted
2024-01-28T09:13:00-0500	<Company>	GdkDmabufFormats need to probably be threadsafe though, so we gotta be careful what we put in there
2024-01-28T09:13:09-0500	<Company>	like, if we add a GdkGPU there
2024-01-28T09:13:09-0500	<mclasen>	its in that branch
2024-01-28T09:13:23-0500	<mclasen>	and the formats object is still immutable there
2024-01-28T09:13:42-0500	<Company>	yeah, immutable anyway - the question is about the properties
2024-01-28T09:14:00-0500	<mclasen>	the properties can change of course
2024-01-28T09:14:07-0500	<mclasen>	thats why we make this properties in the first place
2024-01-28T09:14:11-0500	<mclasen>	so we get change notification
2024-01-28T09:14:17-0500	<Company>	no, I mean the properties of the formats
2024-01-28T09:14:38-0500	<teapot9>	hi, how do I list packages installed from the "testing" repository?
2024-01-28T09:14:55-0500	<mclasen>	well in branch, the GdkDmabufFormats is immutable
2024-01-28T09:15:01-0500	<Company>	can you call gpu_get_thing (formats_get_gpu()) in some random GStreamer thread?
2024-01-28T09:15:06-0500	<mclasen>	if anything changes, you build a new one
2024-01-28T09:15:39-0500	<Company>	or should we have a formats_get_render_device() instead?
2024-01-28T09:16:17-0500	<Company>	and it's definitely gonna be immutable, that's not the quesstion
2024-01-28T09:16:23-0500	<mclasen>	I think my branch adds those getters, as wayland backend api
2024-01-28T09:16:36-0500	<Company>	2. a mutable GdkSurface::dmabuf-formats property
2024-01-28T09:16:58-0500	<Company>	we could add that for 4.14 if we wanted and just return display_get_dmabuf_formats() for now
2024-01-28T09:17:22-0500	<Company>	that's pretty trivial, the hard part is actually setting better formats there
2024-01-28T09:18:01-0500	<Company>	3. clipping of dmabufs, ie handling of subsurface { clip { texture {} } } nodes
2024-01-28T09:18:43-0500	<mclasen>	that last one needs some translation from clip to viewporter, I assume
2024-01-28T09:18:45-0500	<Company>	because that's how to handle padding in some dmabufs
2024-01-28T09:18:52-0500	<Company>	yeah, I think so
2024-01-28T09:19:01-0500	<Company>	and some checks for integerness
2024-01-28T09:19:11-0500	<invoked>	i'll be outside protesting. if by beer/soda you mean 'molotov cocktail', i'll keep one aside for you
2024-01-28T09:19:19-0500	*	invoked kidding
2024-01-28T09:19:29-0500	<Company>	basically a way to pass a cairo_rectangle_int_t *clip to subsurface_set_texture()
2024-01-28T09:20:47-0500	<invoked>	at least the trail strike in germany ended.
2024-01-28T09:20:52-0500	<invoked>	s/trail/rail/
2024-01-28T09:21:21-0500	<Company>	you could then also use that to keep offloading while overlaying (opaque) controls
2024-01-28T09:21:34-0500	<Company>	but that's not really useful
2024-01-28T09:22:44-0500	<Company>	nce we have those 3 things, our dmabuf support should be so far ahead of everything else that we can lean back and waiting for them to catch up
2024-01-28T09:23:06-0500	<luna>	can one enable testing without enabling edge?
2024-01-28T09:23:07-0500	<Company>	where "they" means the whole stack from compositors to multimedia libraries
2024-01-28T09:23:53-0500	<mclasen>	we 'just' need to do proper negotation :)
2024-01-28T09:23:55-0500	<ikke>	no
2024-01-28T09:24:08-0500	<DEEPAKs>	Hi all, do anyone knows how to check which C standard my compiler is using???
2024-01-28T09:24:09-0500	<ikke>	We only build testing for edge
2024-01-28T09:24:12-0500	<luna>	alright
2024-01-28T09:24:27-0500	<luna>	ikke: thx for the answer think i keep this install on stable 3.19.1 but then i know
2024-01-28T09:24:48-0500	<Cindy>	if you need to select a specific C standard, you can do that with an argument
2024-01-28T09:24:54-0500	<quinq>	teapot9, something like, I suppose, apk --from none -X repo list -I
2024-01-28T09:25:27-0500	<Cindy>	like -std=c99 in gcc if you need C99
2024-01-28T09:25:42-0500	<DEEPAKs>	oh! ok, how to know which standard currently my compiler is using?
2024-01-28T09:25:42-0500	<quinq>	Hummm, although list installed wouldn't check repositories, so no.
2024-01-28T09:25:49-0500	<Company>	well, that's kinda Wayland's problem
2024-01-28T09:25:53-0500	<ikke>	apk does not really keep track of where packages came from
2024-01-28T09:26:21-0500	<Cindy>	you'd have to dump the compiler's macros
2024-01-28T09:26:28-0500	<Company>	because it's just going "hey, here's your new formats, I'm sure you're all set for those and don't need to reconfigure libva now"
2024-01-28T09:26:29-0500	<Cindy>	and read __STDC_VERSION__
2024-01-28T09:26:38-0500	<quinq>	This doesn't even print anything: apk list -o
2024-01-28T09:27:10-0500	<ikke>	fyi, origin here refers to the main package name, not the repository
2024-01-28T09:27:26-0500	<Cindy>	like do gcc -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep __STDC_VERSION__
2024-01-28T09:27:48-0500	<quinq>	Humm, what's a main package name?
2024-01-28T09:28:05-0500	<quinq>	Like for packages that âprovideâ another one?
2024-01-28T09:28:40-0500	<Cindy>	in my copy of GCC, it's 201710L
2024-01-28T09:28:50-0500	<Cindy>	so it's using the 2017 version of C
2024-01-28T09:28:51-0500	<Xgc>	DEEPAKs: That's often selectable by you on the command line or other methods.  So your compiler may support more than one version.
2024-01-28T09:28:55-0500	<quinq>	Yeah, I get entries with: apk list -o vim
2024-01-28T09:29:16-0500	<DEEPAKs>	oh! ok, the command returns #define __STDC_VERSION__ 201710L, so it means c17 I guess
2024-01-28T09:29:23-0500	<ikke>	the opposite of subpackage
2024-01-28T09:29:32-0500	<Xgc>	DEEPAKs: The support is usually partial.  Very few compilers, even for the oldest standards, do not support them fully.  Be careful to check.
2024-01-28T09:29:50-0500	<DEEPAKs>	ok Xgc
2024-01-28T09:31:37-0500	<Xgc>	I meant to say, it's difficult to find any compiler with full standard support, for almost any version.
2024-01-28T09:32:01-0500	<DEEPAKs>	oh!
2024-01-28T09:32:31-0500	<militantorc>	what is the mascot fruit of C
2024-01-28T09:32:40-0500	<Xgc>	So you might select say "C99" and your compiler will try.  But it will likely not have full support for that version.
2024-01-28T09:32:56-0500	<harrykar>	DEEPAKs: expecially the latest language revisions
2024-01-28T09:33:09-0500	<militantorc>	Xgc, how many compilers do you test your projects on
2024-01-28T09:33:29-0500	<constxqt>	i need a C expert
2024-01-28T09:33:40-0500	<constxqt>	a consultant if you will
2024-01-28T09:33:46-0500	<harrykar>	DEEPAKs: you have to read compiler's docs
2024-01-28T09:34:16-0500	<teapot9>	my current solution is to `git clone` the aports repository and loop over each packages from `apk info`
2024-01-28T09:34:29-0500	<DEEPAKs>	harrykar, where can I read the compiler's docs? you mean man pages?
2024-01-28T09:34:32-0500	<Xgc>	militantorc: I'm not testing actively these days.  When I did, I used at least one compiler per platform.  Probably 3 or 4 platforms, with differing architectures (which is the main variable of interest).
2024-01-28T09:34:47-0500	<constxqt>	bros how much do i have to pay per hour for a good C consultant
2024-01-28T09:35:03-0500	<militantorc>	i'd like to test on at least gcc and clang
2024-01-28T09:35:09-0500	<militantorc>	maybe also vc and tinycc
2024-01-28T09:38:17-0500	<harrykar>	DEEPAKs: man pages, info pages, web pages whatever. gcc is trerated on gnu's docs, clang in LLVM's docs
2024-01-28T09:38:56-0500	<DEEPAKs>	got it harrykar, thanks
2024-01-28T09:39:20-0500	<harrykar>	DEEPAKs: you're welcome
2024-01-28T09:46:39-0500	<Xgc>	militantorc: Today, I'd do the same, GNU C and clang.  For my embedded work, I was most interested in mistakes in byte order and type/size assumptions.  Those were most easily exposed by picking as many different architectures as possible for testing.
2024-01-28T09:46:58-0500	<constxqt>	cmon there's gotta be at least one C expert around
2024-01-28T09:47:32-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: What are you working on?
2024-01-28T09:47:45-0500	<constxqt>	garbage collection
2024-01-28T09:48:00-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: What are you using for this?
2024-01-28T09:48:06-0500	<constxqt>	C
2024-01-28T09:48:41-0500	<constxqt>	it's a very simple garbage collector
2024-01-28T09:48:48-0500	<constxqt>	but
2024-01-28T09:49:00-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: Oh. You're doing this yourself, not using something like Boehm's?
2024-01-28T09:49:30-0500	<constxqt>	there's some sort of synchronization issue and i'm running into data races and use-after-free bugs very very occasionally in multithreaded programs
2024-01-28T09:49:49-0500	<constxqt>	that's right, not using an off the shelf library like that
2024-01-28T09:50:58-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: I see.  That can be difficult to identify, in general... without serious review.
2024-01-28T09:50:58-0500	<constxqt>	by default i start with a max heap size of like 64 MB or so and run GC whenever the heap grows to that size, doubling the max heap size if there still isn't enough space after the GC cycle
2024-01-28T09:51:30-0500	<Xgc>	and, of course, why you're asking for help.
2024-01-28T09:51:44-0500	<constxqt>	but, to stress test it, i just run a gc cycle on every single allocation. and this is when i start to consistently see things going wrong
2024-01-28T09:53:46-0500	<constxqt>	i don't know what to do other than admit defeat and pay somebody smarter than me to fix it
2024-01-28T09:55:36-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: I'm still rather busy.  But do you have a test case to show / provide for review?
2024-01-28T09:56:13-0500	<mclasen>	Company: tried to summarize this here: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6376
2024-01-28T09:58:19-0500	<constxqt>	i have a reliable way to reproduce the problem, but it's not very small or self contained. you'd probably have to build the project locally or SSH into my VPS
2024-01-28T09:58:37-0500	<mclasen>	Company: we can't remove the item from the hash table if it is already invalid
2024-01-28T09:58:52-0500	<Xgc>	What environment (OS, etc) are you using?
2024-01-28T09:58:52-0500	<mclasen>	since there might already be an entry for the reused key, with a different value
2024-01-28T09:59:36-0500	<mclasen>	and in the previous iteration I had that did it unconditionally and checked the value, and you tore it apart
2024-01-28T09:59:50-0500	<constxqt>	linux half the time, macOS the other half
2024-01-28T10:00:22-0500	<mclasen>	and in the case that the item has actually been removed, there is no problem, since we remove the hash entry when the new texture gets cached
2024-01-28T10:00:47-0500	<Xgc>	If you have a repository, and quick description of the test / issue, I might take a look.
2024-01-28T10:04:19-0500	<Company>	I think what you want to do is steal_extended() and if (value != self) insert() it back
2024-01-28T10:04:52-0500	<Company>	you could also lookup(); if (value == self) remove();
2024-01-28T10:05:12-0500	<Company>	but I'd do it the first way because that's the expected path
2024-01-28T10:05:45-0500	<mclasen>	hmm, that might work
2024-01-28T10:06:24-0500	<mclasen>	all of this feels very much like dancing around a bear that just hasn't noticed you yet
2024-01-28T10:06:30-0500	<mclasen>	but it could turn around at any second
2024-01-28T10:07:25-0500	<mclasen>	how about gsk_gpu_device_begin/end_frame ?
2024-01-28T10:07:50-0500	<mclasen>	but we can also go with the gc_something naming
2024-01-28T10:08:18-0500	<orbea>	invoked: i was reading about farmer protests, is that going on?
2024-01-28T10:08:33-0500	<orbea>	hard to tell what is people making things up sometimes...
2024-01-28T10:10:39-0500	<invoked>	i'm not sure what the farmer protest is about.
2024-01-28T10:11:48-0500	<Company>	no
2024-01-28T10:12:01-0500	<Company>	that feels wrong
2024-01-28T10:12:40-0500	<Company>	that feels like a device should move into an "in_frame" state while the frame is rendering
2024-01-28T10:12:56-0500	<Company>	and a Device is just an auxiliary info struct carrying info about a devie
2024-01-28T10:13:37-0500	<Company>	also, I think the cache should be split from the device
2024-01-28T10:13:53-0500	<Company>	ie there should be a GskGpuCache object
2024-01-28T10:14:15-0500	<Company>	both because the device object is growing lot
2024-01-28T10:14:24-0500	<Company>	and because it's 2 different jobs
2024-01-28T10:14:31-0500	<Company>	but most of all to avoid ref cycles
2024-01-28T10:14:37-0500	<mclasen>	not in this mr, sorry
2024-01-28T10:14:41-0500	<Company>	because images may want to hold a ref to the device
2024-01-28T10:14:46-0500	<Company>	and the cache wants to hold refs to images
2024-01-28T10:14:56-0500	<Company>	of course not
2024-01-28T10:15:20-0500	<Company>	I was just dumping my thoughts on a begin/end_frame() API
2024-01-28T10:15:27-0500	<Company>	and why I don't like it
2024-01-28T10:15:40-0500	<Company>	the split is something for the GdkGPU introduction
2024-01-28T10:16:05-0500	<Company>	where we might decide to merge GskGpuDevice into that
2024-01-28T10:16:25-0500	<Company>	this MR is pretty much good to go I think
2024-01-28T10:17:50-0500	<constxqt>	Xgc: i think i just fixed the bug lol... after days of bashing my head against the wall. sorry for the false alarm
2024-01-28T10:18:36-0500	<constxqt>	if it turns out to not actually be resolved, is it alright if i message you? there is a public repository and i can give some instructions for how to reproduce the problem
2024-01-28T10:20:26-0500	<Amun-Ra>	asking for permision to send msg via irc must be a new thing
2024-01-28T10:25:18-0500	<mclasen>	I'm fixing up the last few things
2024-01-28T10:25:46-0500	<NRK>	constxqt: when will you port ty to use libgrapheme?
2024-01-28T10:25:48-0500	<Xgc>	constxqt: Sure.
2024-01-28T10:28:35-0500	<constxqt>	NRK: whenever `git clone https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc` stops working
2024-01-28T10:28:37-0500	<candide>	Title of constxqt's link: GitHub - JuliaStrings/utf8proc: a clean C library for processing UTF-8 Unicode data
2024-01-28T10:54:52-0500	<Company>	mclasen: you're very good at accessing non-threadsafe variables from different threads ;)
2024-01-28T10:55:07-0500	<mclasen>	what now?
2024-01-28T10:55:38-0500	<Company>	the one review comment I had on your latest version
2024-01-28T10:55:55-0500	<Company>	if we ever go multithreading, we need to go Rust
2024-01-28T10:56:10-0500	<mclasen>	I can replace the cache->image check with checking the use_count
2024-01-28T10:56:11-0500	<Company>	so the borrow checker can do the work
2024-01-28T10:56:57-0500	<Company>	yeah, that's the only way to do it really
2024-01-28T10:56:59-0500	<DEEPAKs>	int arr[2][3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; int (*ptr)[3]; ptr = arr; if you declare and assign like this, then why (ptr+1) and *(ptr+1) is same?? both of this are pointer to the second row
2024-01-28T10:57:07-0500	<mclasen>	its an extra atomic, but ok
2024-01-28T10:57:49-0500	<Company>	it has to
2024-01-28T10:57:53-0500	<DEEPAKs>	Nevermind guys, I immediately get it. my mind works now
2024-01-28T10:58:23-0500	<Company>	in proper code it'd need to be a lock, but we had that discussion above
2024-01-28T11:02:42-0500	<mclasen>	now we should write some code that actually uses textures with threads
2024-01-28T11:04:04-0500	<mclasen>	maybe sophie will get us that
2024-01-28T11:06:03-0500	<Company>	make the gpu renderer split the renering into tiles
2024-01-28T11:06:22-0500	<mclasen>	I've tried that once, actually
2024-01-28T11:06:26-0500	<Company>	easiest example: spawn a thread for every rectangle of the clip region
2024-01-28T11:06:52-0500	<Company>	first job: make the cache threadsafe
2024-01-28T11:06:53-0500	<mclasen>	the problem you end up with is gl contexts and texture upload
2024-01-28T11:07:08-0500	<Company>	one context per thread
2024-01-28T11:07:44-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, the renderers need to share the cache
2024-01-28T11:08:36-0500	<Company>	textures with threads is GStreamer twrritory btw
2024-01-28T11:10:13-0500	<Company>	people always forget that GtkGstSink functions are generally called froma random thread
2024-01-28T11:10:34-0500	<Company>	like, the GL texture builder runs in some random thread already
2024-01-28T11:10:40-0500	<Company>	afaiu
2024-01-28T11:33:07-0500	*	solaraquarion__ is now known as SolarAquarion
2024-01-28T11:36:53-0500	<janLentan>	still struggling with a bug where under GNOME specifically windows are updated with glitches :-( anyone know how to investigate the cause?
2024-01-28T11:37:26-0500	<janLentan>	usually when it shows up, parts of a window are redrawn with green squares or other glitchy stuff whenever things are updated
2024-01-28T11:37:46-0500	<janLentan>	so, like, firefox playing a youtube video shows them reliably, but i can't seem to get a screenshot of one
2024-01-28T11:38:32-0500	<mclasen>	Company: do you want to give the blog post a last look? I added a new section with gotchas for developers
2024-01-28T11:38:38-0500	<mclasen>	if not I'll just post it

2024-01-29T07:45:08-0500	<Company>	because GLX contexts belong to an X Window

2024-01-29T07:45:59-0500	<mclasen>	aren't they sharing textures though?
2024-01-29T07:46:10-0500	<Company>	yes
2024-01-29T07:46:35-0500	<Company>	there are some things they share and some things they don't
2024-01-29T07:47:16-0500	<Company>	mainly, they share all the objects  - so all textures, framebuffers samplers, vaos, shaders, ...
2024-01-29T07:47:52-0500	<Company>	but they don't share the "globals" - the fbconfig, the default framebuffer, the current blend mode, scissor rect, ...
2024-01-29T07:48:37-0500	<mclasen>	in that case, it shouldn't matter what context we delete them in, no?
2024-01-29T07:49:00-0500	<mclasen>	I guess the problem is with the inspectors renderer which uses a different display ?
2024-01-29T07:49:17-0500	<mclasen>	anyway, I'll move the calls
2024-01-29T07:50:42-0500	<mclasen>	do you have a preference for how to fix up the weak unref?
2024-01-29T07:50:55-0500	<Company>	I would just do nothing
2024-01-29T07:51:17-0500	<Company>	that causes the Cached to remain in existence and we can collect multiple weak refs to accumulate
2024-01-29T07:51:22-0500	<Company>	but it simplifies the code
2024-01-29T07:51:27-0500	<Company>	and simple code wins
2024-01-29T07:51:39-0500	<Company>	but that's not a strong opinion
2024-01-29T07:52:04-0500	<Company>	"more correct" is a good argument for me, too
2024-01-29T07:52:19-0500	<FiloSottile>	Or maybe there's a way to run a script from the apkovl before apk tries to install world? The I could create or fix the appropriate symlinks.
2024-01-29T07:56:54-0500	<mclasen>	great, thats my preference too
2024-01-29T07:57:08-0500	<mclasen>	it matches what we do for free already
2024-01-29T07:58:10-0500	<mclasen>	funny we spent all that time getting it threadsafe and what got us is a context
2024-01-29T07:58:51-0500	<LaserEyess>	do properties have to be registered at class instantiation? can they be dynamic?
2024-01-29T08:01:13-0500	<mclasen>	in theory, they could. I practice, no
2024-01-29T08:02:18-0500	<Company>	yuck
2024-01-29T08:02:21-0500	<LaserEyess>	then I wonder if there's a way to set up an object programmatically with a large number of properties
2024-01-29T08:02:35-0500	<LaserEyess>	I'm thinking a few dozen
2024-01-29T08:02:37-0500	<Company>	so when rendering large textures, we were gc'ing multiple times and queueing a new gc real hard
2024-01-29T08:02:46-0500	<ikke>	FiloSottile: The boot usb disk used to be consistently available as /media/usb
2024-01-29T08:03:11-0500	<LaserEyess>	I suppose nothing stops me from making a helper struct for this and looping during *class_init()
2024-01-29T08:03:19-0500	<Company>	LaserEyess: I am now wondering if that is a bad idea and you should not use properties for whatever you're thinking about
2024-01-29T08:03:51-0500	<LaserEyess>	I am also wondering the same, but I want to use them all for binding properties in a column view
2024-01-29T08:04:06-0500	<Company>	but a few dozen is fine
2024-01-29T08:04:26-0500	<Company>	GtkWidget has quite a few
2024-01-29T08:05:25-0500	<LaserEyess>	to avoid any X/Y thing here, I have this RPC I'm parsing, and it gives me 20-30 fields (depending on the thing) that I'd like to display with a listview/columnview widget
2024-01-29T08:05:33-0500	<LaserEyess>	but the RPC keeps updating some of these paramaters
2024-01-29T08:05:40-0500	<LaserEyess>	so I need them as bound properties (I think?)
2024-01-29T08:06:14-0500	<LaserEyess>	boilerplating all of them as properties seems like a lot of work but it also seems like it owuld make things very simple on the GUI side
2024-01-29T08:06:39-0500	<LaserEyess>	and also let me use builder files for the columnview stuff, which would be nice
2024-01-29T08:06:51-0500	<mclasen>	Company: why do we gc multiple times ?
2024-01-29T08:06:54-0500	<mclasen>	is the texture dead already?
2024-01-29T08:07:40-0500	<Company>	mclasen: I was looking at your MR
2024-01-29T08:07:55-0500	<Company>	mclasen: it did maybe_gc(); queue_gc(); in a nested for loop
2024-01-29T08:08:04-0500	<mclasen>	ah yews
2024-01-29T08:08:09-0500	<mclasen>	*yes*
2024-01-29T08:08:14-0500	<mclasen>	I just removed that
2024-01-29T08:08:16-0500	<mclasen>	it was a thinko
2024-01-29T08:08:19-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-01-29T08:08:32-0500	<Company>	good thing we get to review all our code all the time ;)
2024-01-29T08:08:56-0500	<mclasen>	I was  just wrapping maybe_gc/queue_gc around every frame_render call
2024-01-29T08:09:01-0500	<mclasen>	which wasn't the right thing to do
2024-01-29T08:10:08-0500	<FiloSottile>	ikke: /media/usb exists on this system but nothing's mounted there
2024-01-29T08:11:43-0500	<ikke>	Are there entries in /etc/fstab?
2024-01-29T08:15:05-0500	<mclasen>	are you happy with the font options in node files, btw ?
2024-01-29T08:17:12-0500	<Company>	you mean with the idea in general or the MR in particular?
2024-01-29T08:19:03-0500	<mclasen>	the mr. I assume you're ok with the idea since you suggested it, no?
2024-01-29T08:19:14-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-01-29T08:19:21-0500	<Company>	one thing we should check is the defaults
2024-01-29T08:19:32-0500	<mclasen>	I changed that a bit
2024-01-29T08:19:34-0500	<Company>	also
2024-01-29T08:19:46-0500	<Company>	if you drag a node from widget-factory or some GTK app, will it do the right thing?
2024-01-29T08:19:48-0500	<mclasen>	we now recreate the font only if its options aren't the ones we need
2024-01-29T08:20:30-0500	<Company>	where "right thing" means both copying the right font options and using the defaults for everything
2024-01-29T08:21:05-0500	<mclasen>	it depends a bit on how the 'right thing' is defined
2024-01-29T08:21:43-0500	<Company>	pixel-exact identical output on your rawhide box than the person that configured the whole fpont stack on Ubuntu 20.04
2024-01-29T08:21:57-0500	<mclasen>	currently, if no font options are specified, we use 'all default' font options, which does not match what you'd get when the node is used in the app
2024-01-29T08:22:22-0500	<Company>	I think our defaults should not be Cairo's defaults, but GTK's defaults
2024-01-29T08:22:23-0500	<FiloSottile>	ikke: nope, /etc/fstab is empty, but also /etc/fstab is inside the apkovl, I assumed it was looked at too late to affect how the boot disk is mounted?
2024-01-29T08:22:31-0500	<Company>	if there's a difference
2024-01-29T08:22:36-0500	<mclasen>	it may be safer to always serialize font options
2024-01-29T08:22:52-0500	<Company>	of course
2024-01-29T08:23:04-0500	<Company>	but we only print a property if it's different from the default
2024-01-29T08:23:05-0500	<mclasen>	so far I've done a non-default thing
2024-01-29T08:23:23-0500	<mclasen>	I meant we could always print them
2024-01-29T08:23:33-0500	<Company>	why though?
2024-01-29T08:23:47-0500	<mclasen>	since the default is debatable, and what cairo calls default is not necessarily what we use
2024-01-29T08:24:01-0500	<Company>	the default is what happens when you go font {}
2024-01-29T08:24:18-0500	<Company>	so there is going to be a default
2024-01-29T08:24:18-0500	<mclasen>	what happens for that depends on your gtksettings
2024-01-29T08:24:23-0500	<Company>	no, ti doesn't
2024-01-29T08:24:27-0500	<Company>	absolutely not
2024-01-29T08:24:29-0500	<mclasen>	unless you want to treat the node parser as a sandbox
2024-01-29T08:24:34-0500	<Company>	it does the same thing *everywhere*
2024-01-29T08:25:03-0500	<mclasen>	if you want it to match pixels by pixel for what you drag from an app, you better always serialize the font options
2024-01-29T08:25:13-0500	<Company>	yes, you do
2024-01-29T08:25:15-0500	<FiloSottile>	oooooh /dev/usbdisk and remount_fstab_entry, there it is
2024-01-29T08:25:34-0500	<Company>	but you only serialize the values that aren't the fontparser's default
2024-01-29T08:26:18-0500	<Company>	so that a ui file with a "Hello World" label serializes to font { glyphs: "Hello World"; } on a stock GTK install
2024-01-29T08:27:40-0500	<mclasen>	alright then, we can leave the code as it is
2024-01-29T08:28:11-0500	<mclasen>	both node parser and serializer treat the cairo default values as default
2024-01-29T08:28:27-0500	<Company>	is that a good idea?
2024-01-29T08:28:41-0500	<mclasen>	it matches, was my point
2024-01-29T08:29:01-0500	<mclasen>	I can also make my favorite values the defaults
2024-01-29T08:29:14-0500	<Company>	I was wondering about GTK's default values
2024-01-29T08:29:33-0500	<Company>	does GtkSettings set any of them?
2024-01-29T08:29:35-0500	<ikke>	FiloSottile: are you sorted?
2024-01-29T08:30:42-0500	<mclasen>	gtk uses -1 for 'the system default' for antialias and hinting, and false for hint-metrics
2024-01-29T08:31:08-0500	<mclasen>	but these are declared defaults you never see apply, since you always have xsettings / gsettings
2024-01-29T08:31:23-0500	<Company>	and what do those do?
2024-01-29T08:31:41-0500	<FiloSottile>	yep, thank you ikke!
2024-01-29T08:34:17-0500	<mclasen>	the gsettings ? dunno, look at the schemas
2024-01-29T08:34:28-0500	<mclasen>	slight, gray, it seems
2024-01-29T08:34:42-0500	<mclasen>	hinting and hint-font-metrics don't have direct gsettings equivalents
2024-01-29T08:37:24-0500	<mclasen>	that happens to match my favorite values, so maybe I should use those :)
2024-01-29T08:39:17-0500	<Company>	I think we should use the values that the majority of people use
2024-01-29T08:39:42-0500	<Company>	so (a) we reduce the amount of text in nodes in git issues
2024-01-29T08:40:02-0500	<Company>	and (b) our handwritten tests match what people do
2024-01-29T08:40:23-0500	<Company>	instead of the current thing where we get cutoff glyphs but people don't
2024-01-29T08:41:18-0500	<Company>	also, this vte issue would stand out immediately
2024-01-29T08:41:40-0500	<Company>	because instead of font {} it'd go font { hint-metrics: special; hint-style: buggy; }
2024-01-29T08:41:50-0500	<Company>	and then we'd go AHA!
2024-01-29T08:42:10-0500	<Company>	anyway, there's sunshine outside
2024-01-29T08:42:16-0500	<Company>	so I'm gonna go there now
2024-01-29T09:04:14-0500	<LaserEyess>	what does this mean in practice?
2024-01-29T09:04:16-0500	<LaserEyess>	>GTK cannot guarantee that the evaluation did indeed change when the notify gets invoked, but it guarantees the opposite: When it did in fact change, the notify will be invoked.
2024-01-29T09:04:26-0500	<LaserEyess>	I can see how this works for properties, but what about a closure expression?
2024-01-29T09:05:39-0500	<LaserEyess>	or cclosure
2024-01-29T09:13:02-0500	<lv8pv>	I read that an array is a continuous allocated memory space. It that _literary_ continuous ?
2024-01-29T09:18:44-0500	<slidercrank>	lv8pv, ehh. for you, yes :)
2024-01-29T09:19:47-0500	<slidercrank>	I mean physically it could be in separate pages (not necessarily adjacent) but the MMU makes them appear continuous
2024-01-29T09:20:20-0500	<slidercrank>	so consider arrays literally continuous.
2024-01-29T09:21:08-0500	<lv8pv>	good, for if it was my next question would be what happen if i allocated an array that is bigger then any continuous free memory space on the machine =)
2024-01-29T09:21:21-0500	<leeward>	remiliascarlet: Right, I meant the import. The last time I played with it, it used translate-c underneath.
2024-01-29T09:22:07-0500	<lv8pv>	slidercrank: thank you =)

2024-01-29T09:57:37-0500	<mclasen>	Company: with what is in the font-options mr now, I can perfectly reproduce the text rendering from dropped nodes, even with large text
2024-01-29T10:20:06-0500	<hajonnes>	I'm doing 3-4 in k&r There I must be able to convert a negative number to a positive. With 2's complement negative int can be 1 more than positive int. To mediate problems with that one could switch to an 'unsigned int'. But if I want to keep using int, I was thinking of splitting up the number in two. I will later print the number to a string. Is there a smart way to split up the number so that e.g. the number 98765432 is split into 9876 and 5432 or some
2024-01-29T10:20:06-0500	<hajonnes>	other way that is smart, how would you have split it?
2024-01-29T10:21:04-0500	<feaneron>	so, i have good news, and i have bad news
2024-01-29T10:21:15-0500	<feaneron>	which one comes first?
2024-01-29T10:21:55-0500	<hajonnes>	is it not a way to find the position of the left most 1 in a binary number?
2024-01-29T10:22:51-0500	<leeward>	stevan: Could you have the function take a slice of types? You could probably do something with typeInfo to have the result function take a struct.
2024-01-29T10:25:24-0500	<mclasen>	lets hear the good news first
2024-01-29T10:27:30-0500	<feaneron>	it is perfectly possible to make webkitgtk a11y work again. both the webkit and the gtk4 changeset are rather small.
2024-01-29T10:27:55-0500	<feaneron>	that's the good news
2024-01-29T10:29:27-0500	<hajonnes>	I think it was som clever tactic without using << and a while loop.
2024-01-29T10:29:33-0500	<mclasen>	just as we dropped webkit in a bunch of places :)
2024-01-29T10:29:38-0500	<hajonnes>	But I do not remember what it was.

2024-01-29T10:31:43-0500	<hajonnes>	pragma-, :) thanks
2024-01-29T10:32:10-0500	<feaneron>	i think it's best summarized as: /usr/lib/pkgconfig/gtk4-atspi.pc
2024-01-29T10:33:22-0500	<mclasen>	a small changeset with a big side of api, I see
2024-01-29T10:34:17-0500	<feaneron>	to the best of my knowledge, it's a solid step in the opposite direction that gtk has been moving (removing platform-specific stuff)
2024-01-29T10:35:19-0500	<feaneron>	the api itself is merely gtk_at_spi_socket_new() - everything else is handled internally
2024-01-29T10:35:38-0500	<feaneron>	but it's probably an upsetting approach
2024-01-29T10:38:00-0500	<mclasen>	I think I'll leave you in ebassi's hands for negotiating that
2024-01-29T10:38:36-0500	<feaneron>	i've been talking to ebassi about it - this is not going to come as news to him :)
2024-01-29T10:38:43-0500	<mclasen>	I hope so!
2024-01-29T10:39:02-0500	<feaneron>	i was just hoping it could be a topic to the gtk hackfest
2024-01-29T10:39:15-0500	<feaneron>	which sadly i won't be able to attend
2024-01-29T10:40:23-0500	<mclasen>	sure, we can talk about it there. that makes a lot of sense
2024-01-29T10:40:59-0500	<feaneron>	i could also open a merge request with the changeset, if that helps inform the discussion
2024-01-29T10:41:40-0500	<feaneron>	so far it's all in a branch

2024-01-29T10:47:43-0500	<stevan>	leeward: i managed to get this to work: `fn fooN(comptime n: comptime_int, comptime Ts:*const [n]type, f: *const fn(Ts[0], Ts[1]) bool) void`
2024-01-29T10:49:13-0500	<stevan>	but still don't understand how to change `f` to not use indices? is that what you were refering to with typeInfo and take a struct?
2024-01-29T10:57:05-0500	<EvanR>	to convert most negative int to positive int, you can do -x
2024-01-29T10:58:05-0500	<pragma->	yes but &{kr3-4} says no
2024-01-29T10:58:08-0500	<hajonnes>	EvanR, no, since negative int has one more value than positive int, i.e. bigger range.
2024-01-29T10:58:08-0500	<pragma->	uh
2024-01-29T10:58:11-0500	<pragma->	yes but ,{kr3-4} says no
2024-01-29T10:58:12-0500	<candide>	Chapter 3: Control Flow; Exercise 3-4. In a twoâs complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of n equal to -(2^(wordsize-1)). Explain why not. Modify it to print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs.
2024-01-29T10:59:00-0500	<EvanR>	oh, string
2024-01-29T10:59:04-0500	<Company>	mclasen: what's the difference between a 10pt font at 96dpi and a 20pt fonr at 48dpi?
2024-01-29T10:59:10-0500	<EvanR>	carry on
2024-01-29T10:59:43-0500	<pragma->	I don't remember the context of 3-4, but if it's just for printing, you can sprintf(buf, "%d", -x) and then puts(++buf)
2024-01-29T11:00:19-0500	<mclasen>	the dpi informs pixel grid assumptions in the font stack
2024-01-29T11:00:43-0500	<mclasen>	so if you have hinting enabled, it might affect that
2024-01-29T11:01:09-0500	<mclasen>	and also eg the rounding of font metrics that hint-metrics does
2024-01-29T11:01:47-0500	<mclasen>	I prefer no rounding anywhere, and yet, it happens all over the place
2024-01-29T11:02:21-0500	<Company>	my goal is still to kill dpi
2024-01-29T11:02:29-0500	<Company>	but maybe that needs to wait until GTK5
2024-01-29T11:02:34-0500	<leeward>	stevan: Kinda. I think I saw something somewhere explaining how to build structs in comptime, but you'd probably have to use `inline for` to iterate over the array. So after building that struct up (which would look something like `struct { t: T, s: T }`) then you'd pass one in to the function as the caller.
2024-01-29T11:03:03-0500	<Company>	I consider it absolutely stupid that gnome changes the dpi instead of just the font size when going large text
2024-01-29T11:03:14-0500	*	pragma- shrugs.
2024-01-29T11:03:47-0500	<Company>	for the simple reason that font size is something we deal with all the time
2024-01-29T11:03:50-0500	<leeward>	But if you're really only concerned with the 2 types, not the general case, you could just have your implementation function take a T and a ?S, then have 2 wrappers that call the single implementation.
2024-01-29T11:03:55-0500	<Company>	and dpi is this obscure thing that nobody ever checks
2024-01-29T11:04:14-0500	<leeward>	That's probably easier for your users.
2024-01-29T11:04:36-0500	<Company>	and I was assuming they pretty much do the same thing
2024-01-29T11:04:44-0500	<Company>	or at least are intended to do the same thing
2024-01-29T11:05:24-0500	<mclasen>	mostly, but again, hinting and grid-fitting
2024-01-29T11:06:00-0500	<mclasen>	of course, a fixed value of 96 doesn't have to do any more with the actual grid than a text-scaling-factor that is applied on top
2024-01-29T11:06:35-0500	<mclasen>	the only place where there's a change of caching the actual pixel grid is in the renderer
2024-01-29T11:07:36-0500	<hajonnes>	so sprintf prints -x to a buffer, why do you have to have puts(++buf), would not puts(buf) be enough?
2024-01-29T11:07:48-0500	<pragma->	oh
2024-01-29T11:07:52-0500	<pragma->	just x
2024-01-29T11:08:07-0500	<pragma->	you'd have to cast to unsigned int for -x to work
2024-01-29T11:08:12-0500	<pragma->	i don't know why i said -x
2024-01-29T11:08:46-0500	<Company>	I was about to ask
2024-01-29T11:09:01-0500	<pragma->	,cc int x = INT_MIN; char buf[32]; sprintf(buf, "%d", x); puts(buf + 1);
2024-01-29T11:09:03-0500	<candide>	pragma-: 2147483648
2024-01-29T11:09:07-0500	<pragma->	bam
2024-01-29T11:09:09-0500	<Company>	do we need to make the renderers take care of these things when caching glyphs? 
2024-01-29T11:09:21-0500	<Company>	or does the PangoFont take care of that?
2024-01-29T11:10:23-0500	<pragma->	but like i said, i don't remember the context of 3-4 as far as what chapter 3 taught you to do. 3-4 wants you to do what the chapter taught you.
2024-01-29T11:10:47-0500	<stevan>	i'm curious about the general case, but i appreciate the simpler solution for the special case (i suppose realistically N will be rather small).
2024-01-29T11:11:07-0500	<Company>	actually
2024-01-29T11:11:08-0500	<pragma->	it probably doesn't want you to use sprintf(). it probably wants you to do arithmetic or something.
2024-01-29T11:11:21-0500	<Company>	you should probably do some compare tests
2024-01-29T11:11:22-0500	<hajonnes>	I have already made it, just looking for alternative solutions. was curious. what does (buf+1) do?
2024-01-29T11:11:27-0500	<Company>	with all those different values
2024-01-29T11:11:35-0500	<hajonnes>	*finished it.
2024-01-29T11:11:38-0500	<Company>	both to make sure we actually render them correctly
2024-01-29T11:11:38-0500	<pragma->	,cc puts("hello" + 1);
2024-01-29T11:11:39-0500	<candide>	pragma-: ello
2024-01-29T11:11:43-0500	<Company>	and to make sure we parse them properly
2024-01-29T11:12:29-0500	<hajonnes>	Ahh.. nice :)
2024-01-29T11:18:24-0500	<mclasen>	its not ideal - the dpi value is already baked into the glyph  positions, so if you change the dpi in the node file, you get glyphs that are either spaced out or overlapping
2024-01-29T11:19:32-0500	<mclasen>	our nodes kinda capture text in the middle of being turned from text to pixels
2024-01-29T11:21:10-0500	<remiliascarlet>	remiliascarlet: "and a bug in that I can't update my character's position, but that might be an error on my end." I figured out what caused this. In C, I set velocity to 0.0005f because otherwise the player would be too fast to control on my desktop, although on my laptop I had to set it to 0.05f. But in Zig, 0.0005 was so slow that it made it appear as if nothing was moving. So I changed that to 0.1,
2024-01-29T11:21:12-0500	<remiliascarlet>	and now it works as well as it did in C.
2024-01-29T11:23:10-0500	<andrewrk>	leeward, getPtr() does not invalidate any pointers, but any additions to the hash map may cause it to become resized, invalidating previous pointers. are you sure that no elements were added in between those getPtr() calls?
2024-01-29T11:24:23-0500	<mclasen>	Company: fwiw, we do get a 'text-scaling-factor' from gsettings
2024-01-29T11:24:39-0500	<mclasen>	it is decision on our side to fold that into the old gtk-xft-dpi setting
2024-01-29T11:24:54-0500	<mclasen>	we could instead use it to change the font size
2024-01-29T11:25:17-0500	<mclasen>	on X, we only get xsettings, so there we'll be stuck with the dpi thing
2024-01-29T11:26:31-0500	<mclasen>	We should figure out what to do about the clipping induced by bad combinations of font  options
2024-01-29T11:26:32-0500	<Company>	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/commit/7db34005 is great
2024-01-29T11:26:50-0500	<Company>	node-editor needed more help than usual apparently
2024-01-29T11:27:09-0500	<mclasen>	it was an accident that happened when I added the reload action
2024-01-29T11:27:20-0500	<Company>	the clipping is still a Pango bug, isn't it?
2024-01-29T11:27:26-0500	<Company>	or a Cairo bug?
2024-01-29T11:27:28-0500	<Company>	or freetype?
2024-01-29T11:27:51-0500	<mclasen>	freetype, as far as I can see
2024-01-29T11:27:59-0500	<mclasen>	or maybe just a misunderstanding between freetype and cairo
2024-01-29T11:28:09-0500	<mclasen>	lost between too many layers
2024-01-29T11:28:23-0500	<Company>	needs an expert from that area to have a look probably?
2024-01-29T11:28:39-0500	*	Company no idea who works on freetype
2024-01-29T11:28:49-0500	*	Company gestures in general direction of behdad
2024-01-29T11:28:56-0500	<mclasen>	I talked to him about it
2024-01-29T11:29:25-0500	<mclasen>	but I think the expedient thing to do is just to not use combinations of settings that don't work
2024-01-29T11:29:57-0500	<Company>	it sucks that those settings are the default
2024-01-29T11:30:05-0500	<Company>	so any casual font user is gonna encounter them
2024-01-29T11:30:13-0500	<Company>	in their new terminal app
2024-01-29T11:30:15-0500	<mclasen>	our default for hint-metrics is off
2024-01-29T11:30:21-0500	<mclasen>	fedora patches it in
2024-01-29T11:30:31-0500	<mclasen>	or did we upstream that change at some point, I forget
2024-01-29T11:30:57-0500	<mclasen>	nope, still says FALSE here
2024-01-29T11:31:17-0500	<Company>	hint-metrics got a patch from ebassi to turn it on for 100% scale, no?
2024-01-29T11:31:23-0500	<Company>	for 4.12?
2024-01-29T11:31:35-0500	<Company>	in any case: It was broken in node-editor, too
2024-01-29T11:31:51-0500	<Company>	so the default setting for unexperienced developers is "broken"
2024-01-29T11:32:05-0500	<Company>	users rarely see it I suppose
2024-01-29T11:33:39-0500	<mclasen>	I don't see that commit you remember
2024-01-29T11:36:06-0500	<Company>	I was thinking about https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/commit/ba89a22a4
2024-01-29T11:37:12-0500	<mclasen>	oh, right
2024-01-29T11:37:27-0500	<mclasen>	so it is enabled for many people
2024-01-29T11:37:45-0500	<mclasen>	but what can I say, it doesn't seem to work with the default hint-style
2024-01-29T11:39:19-0500	<mclasen>	it is slighly evil to do it here, since that leaves no easy recourse for people to change  it back
2024-01-29T11:40:01-0500	<Company>	yeah, but you decided we don't want to default it to ON and everybody else wanted to have it in use
2024-01-29T11:40:13-0500	<Company>	so that was the compromise you guys came up with
2024-01-29T11:41:23-0500	<mclasen>	anyway, it isn't quite the same thing we do in the node files
2024-01-29T11:41:31-0500	<mclasen>	this is about pangos rounding during layout
2024-01-29T11:41:43-0500	<mclasen>	not about cairo's rounding when looking up glyph extents
2024-01-29T11:41:56-0500	<mclasen>	did I mention there's too many knobs ?
2024-01-29T11:42:36-0500	<mclasen>	oh, but we override the font_options too, I see
2024-01-29T11:43:06-0500	<Company>	yes, there are too many knobs
2024-01-29T11:43:29-0500	<Company>	but whenever I want to nuke them, people come out of the woodwork and tell me those are important
2024-01-29T11:43:34-0500	<Company>	so we didn't kill dpi
2024-01-29T11:43:59-0500	<mclasen>	I we are serious about linear layout, dpi doesn't matter
2024-01-29T11:44:18-0500	<mclasen>	but then people force use to turn on hint-metrics, which is the opposite of linear layout
2024-01-29T11:45:40-0500	<mclasen>	of course, they still don't have actual dpi, so how much good hint-metrics does them is debatable
2024-01-29T11:49:20-0500	<nitrix>	`buf` is an array, so it gets converted to a pointer to its first element, then +1 is usual pointer arithmetic moving it forward by one element.
2024-01-29T12:01:28-0500	*	Guest6085 is now known as weekin2day
2024-01-29T12:02:16-0500	<hergertme>	Company, mclasen: yeah iirc vte does mess with font metrics 
2024-01-29T12:19:49-0500	*	mrgz is now known as neutroniak
2024-01-29T12:21:45-0500	<MangoMan>	As far as I am aware, if I have âstruct a { int x; }â and âstruct b { int x, y; }â I can safely convert pointers of b to pointers of a.  Can I still do this if I made the .x field of a const?
2024-01-29T12:21:49-0500	<MangoMan>	Something like this: https://paste.thomasvoss.com/433
2024-01-29T12:22:19-0500	<MangoMan>	(s/foo_to_bar/bar_to_foo/ in my paste)
2024-01-29T12:27:42-0500	<EvanR>	technically you can't even do that. But you could use the union trick to get the same effect
2024-01-29T12:31:40-0500	<MangoMan>	EvanR: Why not?  From what Iâve read itâs perfectly safe to convert struct b to struct a since the first members are identical
2024-01-29T12:32:08-0500	<EvanR>	aiui that might work but it's not guaranteed to work due to any actual C language rule

2024-01-30T04:49:28-0500	<b_jonas>	emanuele6: sorry what? I thought you were allowed to declare the same extern variable at global scope multiple times in the same compilation unit, as long as the declarations are identical and they don't give an initializer, so you can just have two `extern char **environ;` declarations in the same compilation unit. is this in a C or C++ source file?
2024-01-30T04:51:40-0500	<emanuele6>	oh, i just tested again
2024-01-30T04:51:48-0500	<AmeliaMonaldo>	https://bdcash1.scaletrk.com/click?o=4422&a=6309
2024-01-30T04:51:53-0500	<emanuele6>	if you have   extern char **environ;   it works fine
2024-01-30T04:52:12-0500	<emanuele6>	but the problem is that the program i was compiling on android was using  const
2024-01-30T04:52:45-0500	<emanuele6>	so the declarations where different
2024-01-30T04:53:04-0500	<b_jonas>	ah
2024-01-30T04:55:34-0500	<stevan>	I'm confused about why `fn Foo(comptime n: comptime_int) type { comptime var fields: [n]std.builtin.Type.StructField = undefined; inline for (0..n) |i| { fields[i] = ...` gives an error saying `expected type '?*const anyopaque', found 'comptime_int'` for `i`, while when i do a very similar thing: `comptime var params: [n]std.builtin.Type.Fn.Param = undefined; inline for (0..n) |i| { params[i] = ...` it works?
2024-01-30T04:55:35-0500	<b_jonas>	if it's a different type then that's a problem indeed
2024-01-30T04:56:08-0500	<emanuele6>	but it should not be D:
2024-01-30T04:57:11-0500	<b_jonas>	you could try to work it around by having a separate compilation unit with just extern char **environ; char const **&my_environ = environ; and then declare in a header file and refer to my_environ elsewhere in your project
2024-01-30T04:57:34-0500	<b_jonas>	so in the separate compilation unit you don't have to include unistd.h
2024-01-30T04:58:34-0500	<emanuele6>	that is not what i would do
2024-01-30T04:58:41-0500	<jacobly>	That's the type of the `default_value` field, which is probably not being initialized correctly.
2024-01-30T04:58:57-0500	<emanuele6>	but you can do that
2024-01-30T05:01:38-0500	<stevan>	i see, i thought the problem was with the indexing itself, thanks!
2024-01-30T05:01:46-0500	<b_jonas>	yeah, you'll probably just need to have platform-dependent stuff in your code somewhere, hopefully abstracted away so your code only has to refer to it in a few places
2024-01-30T05:02:00-0500	<emanuele6>	that definitely would not help you compile a program without needing to patch a file
2024-01-30T05:02:39-0500	<emanuele6>	and i guess you can just make the declaration   extern char **   if it is your program to fix the portability issue with android
2024-01-30T05:05:03-0500	<b_jonas>	have you checked first if android has some compatibility ifdef to make unistd.h not do this by the way? like #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L before you include any of the headers?
2024-01-30T05:05:35-0500	<emanuele6>	i linked the source file of android's libc with the declaration...
2024-01-30T05:05:56-0500	<emanuele6>	it does not

2024-01-30T07:39:16-0500	<Company>	feaneron: you're not hacking on pw-media-stream enough :p
2024-01-30T07:39:51-0500	<Company>	the problem with dmabufs is still that they can be randomly rejected because drivers are picky
2024-01-30T07:39:55-0500	<feaneron>	obviously not. webkitgtk is the new pw-media-stream :)

2024-01-30T07:55:48-0500	<Company>	it's not "omg everything's broken"
2024-01-30T07:56:04-0500	<Company>	it's "I used the most complicated setup ever and found a tiny alignment issue"
2024-01-30T07:56:23-0500	<Company>	mclasen: not sure if you're interested in following it, but I filed https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/issues/2274
2024-01-30T07:56:48-0500	<Company>	feaneron: btw, the gpu renderer *generates* dmabuf textures with Vulkan 
2024-01-30T07:57:08-0500	<Company>	if you render_texture() with Vulkan, you get a dmabuf texture (if all works well)
2024-01-30T07:57:51-0500	<mclasen>	I like it too, it is very positive to have somebody use the new stuff and test the limits
2024-01-30T07:59:36-0500	<Rudde>	When Andrew talked about the difficulty bringing async to zig in the latests showtime. Does that mean the difficulty of bringing async in a language without introducing a runtime?
2024-01-30T08:08:04-0500	<somercet>	THE, hey.
2024-01-30T08:08:18-0500	<Company>	what can she do, I still didn't get around to even looking at the large texture stuff
2024-01-30T08:08:43-0500	<Company>	since 4.13.6 is out, it's wave after wave of things to look at...
2024-01-30T08:32:28-0500	<leeward>	andrewrk: I think I did add elements between the getPtr() calls, and when I stopped doing that the problem went away. This feels like the kind of thing that should be in the getPtr() documentation.
2024-01-30T08:34:05-0500	<leeward>	remiliascarlet: That description of your bug makes me think you should be using a timer in your mainloop to try to hit a target frame rate instead of just letting CPU speed throttle the game.
2024-01-30T08:38:39-0500	<ifreund>	leeward: it certainly wouldn't hurt to explicitly document that, feel free to open a PR :)

Could someone kindly help me to create a "Control+q" functionality to close my gtk app or direct me to some tutorial (Code: https://paste.debian.net/1305764/)? Months ago I could find it *somewhere* (or I figured it out) but I lost the file and just cannot seem to succeed anymore. It's driving me crazy... I only had a few lines of code (maybe 5 max) and thought accels where what I used. But either I'm wrong or I'm unable to set 
2024-01-30T08:46:30-0500	<Anon_0000>	this feature up. Thanks!
2024-01-30T08:48:56-0500	<Company>	mclasen: fun discovery of the day: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/render/vulkan/texture.c#L491-515
2024-01-30T08:49:57-0500	<Company>	if a dmabuf has multiple fds, you need to stat them to check if they refer to the same inode
2024-01-30T08:49:58-0500	<mclasen>	sounds plausible
2024-01-30T08:50:18-0500	<mclasen>	even considering recent inode flamewars
2024-01-30T08:50:19-0500	<Company>	no, that's not "plausible", that's "required"
2024-01-30T08:50:43-0500	<mclasen>	I meant: its plausible that the kernel leaks that information in this way
2024-01-30T08:52:30-0500	<Company>	hehe
2024-01-30T08:54:21-0500	<Neui[m]>	You can add actions to a GtkApplication (it implements GActionMap) and then use gtk_application_set_accels_for_action() to assign a app-wide shortcut. https://stackoverflow.com/a/62539833 has an example, you can call g_application_quit() in the action handler
2024-01-30T08:58:12-0500	<Anon_0000>	Thanks, I'll try to get it working right away! I tried the "gtk_application_set_accels_for_action()" bit before but couldn't figure out where I'd get the "const gchar *detailed_action_name". Can I just name it anything I want? Or is "app.open" (from your link) something that is defined somewhere?
2024-01-30T09:00:30-0500	<Neui[m]>	It's the app. prefix + the action name from the g_simple_action_new() call
2024-01-30T09:03:21-0500	<Anon_0000>	Does that mean it's the list from "GApplicationClass" documentation? And I'd have to use "app.shutdown" for control+q?
2024-01-30T09:04:07-0500	<Neui[m]>	No
2024-01-30T09:06:20-0500	<Neui[m]>	https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/getting_started.html#an-application-menu has maybe a better example, 2nd code block from the "An application menu" chapter

2024-01-30T09:13:54-0500	<mclasen>	it says "Using Vulkan"
2024-01-30T09:14:01-0500	<Company>	with the Vulkan renderer, too?
2024-01-30T09:14:31-0500	<mclasen>	yes, despite plenty of turnip noise
2024-01-30T09:14:42-0500	<mclasen>	I really hate cute names in error messages

2024-01-30T09:18:24-0500	<alatiera>	also is anyone really using vulkan?

2024-01-30T09:19:46-0500	<Company>	not sure if they're "really" using it
2024-01-30T09:19:55-0500	<Company>	but definitely testing
2024-01-30T09:19:56-0500	<alatiera>	maybe if there's a blogpost per week they will keep coming
2024-01-30T09:20:15-0500	<Company>	I still have no idea what's gonna happen with nvidia in F40
2024-01-30T09:20:26-0500	<Company>	nvk is Vulkan 1.3 compliant since yesterday
2024-01-30T09:20:43-0500	<Company>	which means there's a working nvidia driver for modern cards
2024-01-30T09:21:02-0500	<Company>	and GTK will automatically pick Vulkan if GL isn't available
2024-01-30T09:21:15-0500	<Company>	(though it might pick software rendering or zink still)
2024-01-30T09:21:31-0500	<euouae>	Hello, does C89 support defining variables anywhere in the body of a function?
2024-01-30T09:21:42-0500	<Company>	in any case, there's a good chance that some people run GTK with Vulkan in F40
2024-01-30T09:22:44-0500	<Amun-Ra>	C99+
2024-01-30T09:24:15-0500	<euouae>	thank you Amun-Ra
2024-01-30T09:24:24-0500	<Amun-Ra>	no worries
2024-01-30T09:24:44-0500	<euouae>	so e.g. for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) { int j = i; } is not C89 right?
2024-01-30T09:24:51-0500	<fizzie>	That's fine.
2024-01-30T09:24:58-0500	<fizzie>	The declaration is at the beginning of a block.
2024-01-30T09:25:03-0500	<Anon_0000>	Do both links (stackoverflow and the gtk link) assume that I have a menu? Whatever I found months ago worked without a menu and with an empty window â if those links assume a menu, do you know another way of doing it?
2024-01-30T09:25:03-0500	<euouae>	ah, so C89 requires at the beginning of a scope block?
2024-01-30T09:25:08-0500	<Amun-Ra>	yes
2024-01-30T09:25:31-0500	<euouae>	so void f() { int i = 1; puts(...); { int j = i; } } is fine?
2024-01-30T09:25:32-0500	<Amun-Ra>	and for (int i = 0; â¦; â¦) would not be fine too
2024-01-30T09:25:32-0500	<Neui[m]>	They both create a menu, but you can ignore it
2024-01-30T09:26:12-0500	<Amun-Ra>	euouae: that's ok
2024-01-30T09:26:18-0500	<euouae>	alright, thank you for clarifying.
2024-01-30T09:26:24-0500	<Anon_0000>	Okay. I'm doing something wrong then. 
2024-01-30T09:26:26-0500	<Neui[m]>	In the second link ignore the gtk_builder stuff as it's for the menu
2024-01-30T09:26:40-0500	<Amun-Ra>	you can check that with gcc -std=c89 -Wextra (o -Wpedantic, I don't remember)
2024-01-30T09:27:01-0500	<euouae>	yeah but I'm not compiling standard code and I'm not sure how that'd fare
2024-01-30T09:27:15-0500	<euouae>	(and if you're wondering why I'd care for C89, it's because of support of old compilers)
2024-01-30T09:27:19-0500	<Amun-Ra>	you can test it on small sample code:>
2024-01-30T09:27:25-0500	<Anon_0000>	The second link needs "G_APPLICATION_CLASS" though, right? I don't have that (and the first link doesn't either)
2024-01-30T09:27:28-0500	<euouae>	ah right of course. thanks
2024-01-30T09:30:56-0500	<xv22>	hello
2024-01-30T09:31:15-0500	<Neui[m]>	It's not related to actions, so ignore that. You're using the signals way, not inheriting it (where its needed)

2024-01-30T09:43:00-0500	<jonesv>	pj: Alpine doesn't distribute rust dynamic libraries -> is it by choice, or is it just that nobody has packaged rust dynamic libraries? Because technically it should work just like for C++, right?
2024-01-30T09:43:09-0500	<jonesv>	divVerent: got it, then for Go there is no way right now :)
2024-01-30T09:43:50-0500	<somercet>	He shows how to set up a menu item like _Quit to have a kbd accelerator.
2024-01-30T09:44:22-0500	<pj[m]>	jonesv: how is that supposed to work "just like C++"?
2024-01-30T09:44:46-0500	<pj[m]>	You mean libraries to compile to C dynamic libraries?
2024-01-30T09:47:27-0500	<Anon_0000>	Thanks, Neui[m], this actually works (although I had to change line 17 of youor pastebin to "{ "quit", quit_activated, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0,0,0} }" or else I'd get "error: missing initializer for field âpaddingâ of âGActionEntryâ {aka âstruct _GActionEntryâ} [-Werror=missing-field-initializers]". I certainly didn't do it this way months ago, but that doesn't really matter and I'm happy it works â thank you for that! I certa

2024-01-30T09:48:34-0500	<somercet>	Don't feel bad, I'm writing a GTK app and it is a minefield of poorly documented "Oh, actually we do it this way..."
2024-01-30T09:49:50-0500	<Anon_0000>	Glad to know more experienced programmers feel similiar like I do. It does help me a bit!
2024-01-30T09:52:48-0500	<Neui[m]>	You seems to use -Werror=missing-field-initializers which causes the error which is normally just a warning
2024-01-30T09:52:55-0500	<somercet>	hah, this GTK app I'm working on is my biggest C project ever.
2024-01-30T09:53:11-0500	<Anon_0000>	Indeed, Neui[m] .
2024-01-30T09:53:39-0500	<somercet>	maybe just use -Werror
2024-01-30T09:54:02-0500	<Neui[m]>	-Werror turns every warning into an error
2024-01-30T09:54:25-0500	<d_val>	Hey, can I talk about programming practice here? what justify splitting up long function into smaller ones? because it is going to only be called at a single place and all of its functions doesn't really fit together like not "do one thing and do it well" way
2024-01-30T09:55:01-0500	<Anon_0000>	That's great somercet ! I plan to create a gtk app which is my biggest c project as well. I actually do use -Werror too â not sure why I explicity set -Werror=missing-field-initializers though.
2024-01-30T09:55:25-0500	<lb90>	Another question:
2024-01-30T09:55:35-0500	<lb90>	I have to implement empty_frame() on Windows, too
2024-01-30T09:56:18-0500	<lb90>	Should I add new stubs or just remove the wanring message from gdk_draw_context_default_empty_frame?
2024-01-30T09:56:18-0500	<somercet>	yeah, I don't have that "{0,0,0}" bit set, and -Werror doesn't seem to twig it.
2024-01-30T09:56:23-0500	<lb90>	*warning*
2024-01-30T09:56:28-0500	<user71>	I've heard that functions should fit entirely on screen for better overview. This advice comes from the days of 80x24 crt terminals. I'm sure there are other opinions.
2024-01-30T09:56:33-0500	<d_val>	It's just I'm 4 nested layer deep writing something and I don't feel justify to have `while (1) procedure();` everywhere
2024-01-30T09:56:57-0500	<lb90>	From what I can tell, it's mostly needed on Wayland
2024-01-30T09:57:38-0500	<somercet>	I would not have started this if I hadn't figured something out about GUIs, GTK and OOP...
2024-01-30T09:57:45-0500	<Anon_0000>	Maybe the compiler doesn't  normally warn for missing field initializers â Werror couldn't create an error then.
2024-01-30T09:58:32-0500	<somercet>	namely, altering GtkWidgets is stupid, unless you specifically want to alter or add to them.
2024-01-30T09:58:43-0500	<user71>	It looks like you already have a different theory
2024-01-30T09:59:05-0500	<Neui[m]>	It seems the warning is added by -Wextra
2024-01-30T09:59:05-0500	<somercet>	I'm using latest gcc, "-std=gnu99 -Werror -Wall"
2024-01-30T09:59:07-0500	<user71>	a philosophy, rather
2024-01-30T09:59:15-0500	<somercet>	yah
2024-01-30T09:59:26-0500	<Anon_0000>	Could you give an example, please? Altering in what way?
2024-01-30T10:00:17-0500	<Anon_0000>	I see. Yep, I have -Wall -Wextra- Werror and a lot more active. That would explain why I see it and somercet doesn't.
2024-01-30T10:01:18-0500	<somercet>	What I mean is, every GTK app I've seen is either spaghetti code, or every GtkWidget is extended to force program logic into what is nominally a display widget.
2024-01-30T10:02:33-0500	<somercet>	So I created a GObject for this app, and it runs the widgets "inside" it. It keeps program logic and display logic separated.
2024-01-30T10:03:11-0500	<somercet>	I'm basically imposing MVC/MVP on GTK, and it's saving me a lot of problems.
2024-01-30T10:03:24-0500	<ebassi>	lb90: !6144 is +1 from me; I keep meaning to press the button, but it slides off the review list
2024-01-30T10:05:18-0500	<Company>	lb90: implement it in Windows
2024-01-30T10:05:35-0500	<lb90>	ebassi Company: ok :)
2024-01-30T10:06:06-0500	<Anon_0000>	Seems to be useful, but I have to say it's beyond my understanding of programming. Although I did code stuff before that was actually useful and functional, I really am just a beginner. And according to the internet, MVC/MVP is quite difficult to do. Impressive though, that you created something like that!
2024-01-30T10:06:16-0500	<Company>	what really should happen is that the base empty_frame() gets removed and code crashes when it doesn't implement it
2024-01-30T10:06:19-0500	<somercet>	hah, "creating"
2024-01-30T10:06:22-0500	<somercet>	I hope
2024-01-30T10:06:26-0500	<Company>	because it's kinda mandatory that backends take a look
2024-01-30T10:06:58-0500	<Company>	even though the majority of them wants to no-op
2024-01-30T10:07:04-0500	<Anon_0000>	Or imitating, if that's more correct
2024-01-30T10:07:42-0500	<somercet>	More like replacing. I have an old GTK2 app I want to run in GTK3. Well, several, actually.
2024-01-30T10:09:57-0500	<Anon_0000>	Wait, that sounds like it's going to be a lot of work to upgrade to the next gtk version. Maybe in a year or so I'd like to upgrade debian â I was hoping upgrading the app would be not to much work. What is your experience with it so far?
2024-01-30T10:10:56-0500	<Habbie>	i'm writing an APKBUILD for a rust library right now
2024-01-30T10:11:04-0500	<Habbie>	i would also like to know if i can even submit that
2024-01-30T10:11:20-0500	<hajonnes>	do I always have to give  a pointer an address. E.g. bool *negative; *negative = false; Does not seems to work. But if I do not care where the pointer is pointing must I still create a dummy variable for it to point at to be able to use it?

2024-01-30T10:12:19-0500	<Habbie>	well yes
2024-01-30T10:12:34-0500	<bl4ckb0ne>	is there an alpinelinux equivalent of systemd-tmpfiles?
2024-01-30T10:12:58-0500	<jonesv>	pj: I mean that instead of pulling the source code and linking statically with cargo, it should be possible to ship a rust executable that depends on system packages, where those system packages are rust dynamic libraries, right?
2024-01-30T10:13:19-0500	<somercet>	Well, this app has a single large custom GtkWidget that uses a lot of GDK2 calls... and GDK got gutted and rebuilt when it became GDK3.
2024-01-30T10:13:21-0500	<EvanR>	bool * negative = NULL; now negative is initialized to a pointer guaranteed not to point to a valid object
2024-01-30T10:13:32-0500	<jonesv>	pj: It's not because it's Rust that everything should be statically link, is it?
2024-01-30T10:13:32-0500	<somercet>	So it is almost un-portable.
2024-01-30T10:13:54-0500	<Anon_0000>	Oh dear.
2024-01-30T10:13:59-0500	<somercet>	yah
2024-01-30T10:14:36-0500	<somercet>	Another one I would like to tackle is emelFM, that one is almost spaghetti code.
2024-01-30T10:15:24-0500	<Anon_0000>	What whould you do to prevent spaghetti code though? Just modularize it?
2024-01-30T10:15:54-0500	<somercet>	yes. That's why I'm using a GObject.
2024-01-30T10:16:34-0500	<Anon_0000>	How would this look like in its very basic structure?
2024-01-30T10:17:24-0500	<Anon_0000>	Judging from the documentation of Gobject it's quite extensive
2024-01-30T10:17:32-0500	<somercet>	Well, if I complete it, I'll let you take a look at it. If I fail, I'd rather not do so in public.
2024-01-30T10:17:55-0500	<somercet>	GObject has a lot less going on than GtkWidget.
2024-01-30T10:18:07-0500	<somercet>	never mind all the derived classes.
2024-01-30T10:18:09-0500	<aurly>	A pointer points to a bit of memory. *negative = false writes to that bit of memory. You'll want to control where it goes and not write to random places.
2024-01-30T10:19:09-0500	<EvanR>	yes if you assign through it you want it to be pointing at a valid object first
2024-01-30T10:19:31-0500	<somercet>	Also, and here's the big one... GLib is 1000x as stable as GTK.
2024-01-30T10:19:52-0500	<Anon_0000>	Stable as in "doesn't change as often"?
2024-01-30T10:20:12-0500	<somercet>	GLib2 is on it's third major revision of GTK.
2024-01-30T10:20:18-0500	<hajonnes>	aurly, so there is no way that it automatically points to a place that gets reserved for my writing e.g. a bool size space. It only reserves a place in memory for the address?
2024-01-30T10:21:19-0500	<hajonnes>	I mean I do not care if it is a random place, just as long as I do not disrupt something,
2024-01-30T10:21:39-0500	<aurly>	Yup, it's just the pointer. Whatever it points to needs to be dealt with separately
2024-01-30T10:21:49-0500	<hajonnes>	:) thanks.
2024-01-30T10:22:19-0500	<EvanR>	if it's an object that is used for something important, I wouldn't call this a dummy variable
2024-01-30T10:22:40-0500	<EvanR>	in which case the norm is to explicitly list it somewhere, like a global or static local variable
2024-01-30T10:22:48-0500	<Xgc>	hajonnes: What's the point of using a pointer if you don't seem to have a need for that?
2024-01-30T10:22:58-0500	<EvanR>	spooky invisible actions suck
2024-01-30T10:24:16-0500	<Anon_0000>	Did you read the glib manual prior to your project? Or did you use some git repos that provided examples? Apparently (according to the internet), c programmers writing gtk apps should know at least the basics of glib because of memory leaks.
2024-01-30T10:24:37-0500	<somercet>	I've been all over the docs.
2024-01-30T10:25:27-0500	<Anon_0000>	Must've taken a lot of time then. Surely impressive
2024-01-30T10:25:33-0500	<somercet>	They read like the author thought GLib/GTK might have users someday, but had no idea what they would want...
2024-01-30T10:26:40-0500	<somercet>	I was trying to figure out async file IO, and how to read a file backwards.
2024-01-30T10:27:41-0500	<somercet>	now don't spread this around
2024-01-30T10:28:36-0500	<hajonnes>	Xgc, to make a variable available across multiple functions even if they return a value that is not the pointer.
2024-01-30T10:28:38-0500	<somercet>	but I opened up ChatGPT (first time) and said, "Do you know what tac(1) is? Do you know what GNOME GLib2 is? Okay, can you write tac in GLib?"
2024-01-30T10:29:19-0500	<somercet>	the compile command it have me was wrong, but it worked (single file only).
2024-01-30T10:29:47-0500	<somercet>	Then I asked it, "Now, can you write tac using the GLib async file methods?"
2024-01-30T10:29:51-0500	<somercet>	Well, it failed.
2024-01-30T10:30:02-0500	<somercet>	Wouldn't compile, wouldn't run.

2024-01-30T10:30:32-0500	<Anon_0000>	Is TAC "Type Allocation Code"? And if so: what is it supposed to do?
2024-01-30T10:30:34-0500	<somercet>	But it have me enough of a hint that I now have a GTask loading my file.
2024-01-30T10:30:41-0500	<somercet>	are you on linux?
2024-01-30T10:30:46-0500	<Anon_0000>	Yes
2024-01-30T10:30:51-0500	<EvanR>	pass a pointer to the shared object to all the functions that need access to it
2024-01-30T10:30:53-0500	<somercet>	type "man tac"
2024-01-30T10:31:10-0500	<EvanR>	but said object needs to be declared somewhere
2024-01-30T10:31:21-0500	<EvanR>	or allocated
2024-01-30T10:31:23-0500	<Anon_0000>	Oh, I see. 
2024-01-30T10:31:36-0500	<somercet>	Like I said, I was trying to read a file line-by-line in reverse.
2024-01-30T10:31:43-0500	<hajonnes>	yes. yes.
2024-01-30T10:31:46-0500	<hajonnes>	:)
2024-01-30T10:32:15-0500	<Neui[m]>	tac is the reverse of cat if you haven't figured out the pun
2024-01-30T10:32:26-0500	<somercet>	ChatGPT was mixing g_file_load_contents_async() with GIOChannel
2024-01-30T10:32:40-0500	<somercet>	I mean, it was awful.
2024-01-30T10:32:45-0500	<Anon_0000>	I actually haven't. That's great, Neui[m] !
2024-01-30T10:33:20-0500	<somercet>	But if you want to ask a thousand stupid questions about basic GLib/GTK functionality, it works.
2024-01-30T10:33:59-0500	<somercet>	I may never have noticed the g_strsplit() function if it hadn't used it.
2024-01-30T10:34:56-0500	<somercet>	And by "works" I mean, you'll have to debug whatever answer it gave you. But debugging is the greatest teacher of them all. :-D

2024-01-30T10:42:35-0500	<EvanR>	yes
2024-01-30T10:44:22-0500	<hajonnes>	nice, thanks for the tip, If I point negative to an other variable before I freed, I would have no way of pointing it back and I would have a memory leak?
2024-01-30T10:46:14-0500	<Anon_0000>	Sure. Now that I'm rereading it, maybe it sounded a little bit harsh or derogatory ("derogatory" was translated and hopefully means what I think it means). I didn't mean it that way though.
2024-01-30T10:46:30-0500	<EvanR>	you wouldn't be able to free it before the program ends, not really a leak unless you do that repeatedly
2024-01-30T10:47:15-0500	<somercet>	np
2024-01-30T10:51:11-0500	<hajonnes>	ok, thanks for your help :)
2024-01-30T10:57:59-0500	<nitrix>	hajonnes, Pointers are like other regular objects, the only difference is that the value that they store are the addresses of other objects. All these objects are independent from one another.
2024-01-30T10:59:58-0500	<nitrix>	hajonnes, char *p = "abc"; // This is two different objects: (1) a char *, so a pointer to a character, which has automatic storage (2) a string literal, which has type char[4], contains a string and has static storage.
2024-01-30T11:01:18-0500	<nitrix>	hajonnes, char *p = malloc(4); strcpy(p, "abc"); // Again two objects, but p is automatic and the other object doesn't have a name but is allocated.
2024-01-30T11:01:56-0500	<nitrix>	hajonnes, And I can do crazier things. char *p2 = p; // Now I have two pointers to that same object.
2024-01-30T11:02:37-0500	<nitrix>	(We're now at 3 objects, etc)
2024-01-30T11:06:28-0500	<nitrix>	You can have pointers point at named objects, char *y = &z; and you can have pointer pointers at other pointers too. char **x = &y;
2024-01-30T11:06:37-0500	<hajonnes>	nitrix, what about int *p = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int). Do I really have to cast it with (int*)?
2024-01-30T11:07:01-0500	<nitrix>	No. malloc returns a value that has type `void *` and C lets you convert implicitly from and to `void *`.
2024-01-30T11:07:41-0500	<hajonnes>	ok. thanks :)
2024-01-30T11:08:00-0500	<nitrix>	The cast is not even a good "visual indicator", it can actually hide bugs.
2024-01-30T11:08:01-0500	<nitrix>	,dontcast
2024-01-30T11:08:02-0500	<candide>	Casts are explicit and forceful conversions. In general, all conversions that are safe can be performed without the cast operator (though sometimes requiring the help of a temporary variable). It's advisable for everyone to stay away from casts as they disable diagnostics and will often hide serious problems. Inline arithmetic, bogus APIs, const incorrectness and old code trying to be generic are perhaps the few legitimate uses left.
2024-01-30T11:08:04-0500	<candide>	T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is more robust than T *p = malloc(sizeof (T)) because sizeof *p will always be the correct size of T and it prevents unnecessarily repeating the T (DRY principle). If sizeof (T) is used and later one of the T's is changed there will be a mismatch. T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is more concise and easier to read, especially when T is a compound type.

2024-01-30T11:08:14-0500	<nitrix>	hajonnes, Have a look at these twos.

2024-01-30T11:20:06-0500	<pj[m]>	rust doesn't really support the concept of "I have library X that will be loaded dynamically with program Y"
2024-01-30T11:20:23-0500	<pj[m]>	unless it's a C dynamic lib
2024-01-30T11:23:41-0500	<Habbie>	what if the lib is in rust but the consumer is in C?
2024-01-30T11:24:15-0500	<Habbie>	( https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/ for https://blog.powerdns.com/2024/01/30/first-release-candidate-of-powerdns-dnsdist-1.9.0 )
2024-01-30T11:24:45-0500	<pj[m]>	You can then compile it into static archive or C dynamic lib
2024-01-30T11:25:33-0500	<pj[m]>	but that's only possible because the library and consumer are written in such way
2024-01-30T11:26:08-0500	<pj[m]>	you can't take random rust lib and compile it differently and have it work
2024-01-30T11:26:48-0500	<invoked>	and wrt to golang i'm not sure dynamic stuff outside of plugins makes sense.

2024-01-30T12:02:34-0500	<jonesv>	pj: hmm...  so what does it mean for a distro to distribute a Rust executable? Is the package maintainer responsible for checking the security vulnerabilities in the transitive dependencies and somehow patch them?
2024-01-30T12:02:47-0500	<nitrix>	preyalone, If it does, what encoding would it be?
2024-01-30T12:03:15-0500	<jonesv>	pj: so if you have 100 rust executables that statically link a crypto dependency, and that crypto dependency needs to be patched, then 100 package maintainers will have to go manually patch and rebuild that executable?

2024-01-30T12:05:32-0500	<pj[m]>	it really depends on how badly the maintainer wants to use the dynamic libraries and on the software packaged
2024-01-30T12:06:02-0500	<invoked>	not really different in my opinion, it's just a deployment difference
2024-01-30T12:06:03-0500	<pj[m]>	jonesv: if the program rolled own crypto then it's same or even worse situation which you can't even change/patch

2024-01-30T12:09:26-0500	<jonesv>	I don't get how it makes a difference: if the crypto lib is linked statically, it means that it needs to be maintained independently for each package that links it, right?
2024-01-30T12:09:49-0500	<pj[m]>	no
2024-01-30T12:10:23-0500	<pj[m]>	generally you can see which version is being compiled it, and you patch only the affected stuff
2024-01-30T12:10:44-0500	<EvanR>	utf-9
2024-01-30T12:11:31-0500	<jonesv>	But then the "package maintainer" of the Rust crypto library has to go update all the packages that depend on it, instead of just updating the dynamic library?
2024-01-30T12:12:06-0500	<nitrix>	You pick UTF-8 now and you have a new problem in 10 years when Emojii-42 comes out.
2024-01-30T12:12:28-0500	<consus>	the other way around
2024-01-30T12:12:43-0500	<jonesv>	I'm confused
2024-01-30T12:12:55-0500	<consus>	say you have a program
2024-01-30T12:12:58-0500	<consus>	foo
2024-01-30T12:13:06-0500	<consus>	it wants sha256 crate
2024-01-30T12:13:27-0500	<consus>	foo 1.1 wanta sha256 2.5
2024-01-30T12:13:56-0500	<consus>	say a critical bug is discovered
2024-01-30T12:14:06-0500	<consus>	sha256 2.5.1 is out
2024-01-30T12:15:14-0500	<consus>	at this point it kinda worth to refresh cargo.lock during building foo 1.1 in order to grab sha256 2.5.1
2024-01-30T12:15:24-0500	*	actioninja7 is now known as actioninja
2024-01-30T12:15:24-0500	<nitrix>	And while UTF-8 has unified some stuff, it's still an abomination to to render. Most fonts partially implement a subset of the glyphs and you need fallbacks, just because the codepoints and all the permutations of how you can combine them are too absurd. And that doesn't even dip into normalization.
2024-01-30T12:15:44-0500	<nitrix>	The status quo shouldn't dictate what C does because people precisely use C when they have to break the status quo.
2024-01-30T12:16:31-0500	<consus>	the good news is that is can easily be automated based on rustsec advisories
2024-01-30T12:16:38-0500	<nitrix>	We could make C characters always be 8-bits, but what do you do on a system that isn't 8-bits? You use C. Because it's the only language that is still flexible enough.
2024-01-30T12:18:00-0500	<EvanR>	nitrix, are you one of these people who doubt the relevant of unicode is 2023
2024-01-30T12:18:23-0500	<EvanR>	perhaps you have to support windows codepages or something
2024-01-30T12:19:09-0500	<EvanR>	rendering international text isn't really a utf-8 specific issue
2024-01-30T12:19:17-0500	<EvanR>	(the encoding scheme)
2024-01-30T12:20:04-0500	<EvanR>	relevance* in* 2024*
2024-01-30T12:20:17-0500	<nitrix>	No, the argument is that text and encoding is a complex problem that has evolved and will continue to evolve.
2024-01-30T12:22:29-0500	<abdellah>	hi
2024-01-30T12:23:47-0500	<nitrix>	Whatever you enforce in the language means that you can't deviate from it and C is usually the language that people go to when they want this sort of control.
2024-01-30T12:24:29-0500	<EvanR>	which is weird because C doesn't define specifically what character set you will end up with xD
2024-01-30T12:25:03-0500	<EvanR>	be it ascii character set, unicode, or klingon
2024-01-30T12:25:41-0500	<MangoMan>	nitrix: Rendering isnât really an issue with UTF-8 though is it?  UTF-8 is just how we encode stuff, it has nothing to do with how different individual codepoints combine together to form glyphs or any of that
2024-01-30T12:25:58-0500	<MangoMan>	Normalization too is also not really a UTF-8 problem
2024-01-30T12:26:07-0500	<nitrix>	Normalization is a very UTF-8 problem.
2024-01-30T12:26:14-0500	<MangoMan>	Itâs a Unicode problem
2024-01-30T12:26:25-0500	<nitrix>	It's an encoding problem, of Unicode.
2024-01-30T12:26:52-0500	<nitrix>	The very definition of why you need normalization is because there are multiple possible encodings for the same codepoint.
2024-01-30T12:26:57-0500	<MangoMan>	Stuff like normalization isnât in the domain of UTF-8.  You could use your own new encoding and youâll still need to deal with normalization
2024-01-30T12:27:00-0500	<jonesv>	So the package maintainer of sha256 has to find that foo uses it, and to modify the cargo.lock of foo. Meaning that the maintainer of sha256 now has to "partly maintain" foo, together with the maintainers of all the libraries on which foo depends. Correct?
2024-01-30T12:27:03-0500	<nitrix>	It is. Stop being an idiot.
2024-01-30T12:27:27-0500	<MangoMan>	#	define PRIsU8 "%.*s"
2024-01-30T12:27:27-0500	<MangoMan>	#	define U8_PRI_ARGS(sv) ((int)(sv).len), ((sv).p)
2024-01-30T12:27:34-0500	<MangoMan>	whoops, didnât mean to paste that
2024-01-30T12:27:43-0500	<MangoMan>	But no, there arenât multiple encodings of the same codepoint
2024-01-30T12:27:45-0500	<EvanR>	utf-8 is an encoding scheme for unicode, which consists of a character set, encodings, text processing algorithms, application notes for common things you would do with text
2024-01-30T12:27:48-0500	<MangoMan>	Each codepoint has one UTF-8 encoding
2024-01-30T12:27:51-0500	<EvanR>	but some people call all that utf-8
2024-01-30T12:27:55-0500	<jonesv>	consus: or the maintainer of foo is responsible for updating all the transitive dependencies of foo, which makes them the maintainer of possibly hundreds of packages, but just for foo (not for others)
2024-01-30T12:27:57-0500	<EvanR>	and also doubt the relevance of it in 2024
2024-01-30T12:28:02-0500	<EvanR>	which is hilarious
2024-01-30T12:28:13-0500	<MangoMan>	The issue is multiple combinations of codepoints can form the same user-precieved graphemes/glyphs
2024-01-30T12:28:21-0500	<Company>	hergertme_: yes, software rendering is the worst performance difference
2024-01-30T12:28:22-0500	<nitrix>	MangoMan, You're incorrect. There are composed and decomposed form.
2024-01-30T12:28:25-0500	<Company>	it's something live 5x
2024-01-30T12:28:36-0500	<nitrix>	Stop talking like you're an authority on the subject, I know you're wrong.
2024-01-30T12:28:54-0500	<EvanR>	nitrix calm down, it sounds like you're just lashing out now
2024-01-30T12:29:21-0500	<jonesv>	I don't see how it is not completely destroying the "package maintainer" model
2024-01-30T12:29:43-0500	<EvanR>	the original question was about string data types
2024-01-30T12:30:58-0500	<MangoMan>	itrix: âÃâ (U+00C5) and âAÌâ (U+0041 + U+030A)look the same, and normalization exists to so that they get treated the same, but they arenât âthe same codepointâ
2024-01-30T12:31:00-0500	<nitrix>	There isn't a string type.
2024-01-30T12:31:05-0500	<MangoMan>	One is one codepoint, the other is two different codepoints
2024-01-30T12:31:44-0500	<pj[m]>	it's not completely destroy the model
2024-01-30T12:32:01-0500	<MangoMan>	And that is a problem that exists because of Unicode, not because of UTF-8 or UTF-16 or whatever
2024-01-30T12:32:06-0500	<pj[m]>	package maintainers already have to maintain all the dependencies their package uses one way or another
2024-01-30T12:32:17-0500	<pj[m]>	regardless of the software language used
2024-01-30T12:33:10-0500	<jonesv>	How so? If foo depends on openssl, the maintainer of foo is not responsible for applying security updates to openssl, right?
2024-01-30T12:34:17-0500	<EvanR>	they don't actually look the same here xD
2024-01-30T12:34:31-0500	<EvanR>	for better or worse
2024-01-30T12:34:44-0500	<jonesv>	pj: so as long as openssl does not break the API compatibility, then the maintainer of foo does not have to do anything. If openssl breaks ABI compatibility, then foo has to be recompiled (or just re-linked?), but I guess this can be automated?
2024-01-30T12:35:01-0500	<jonesv>	(sorry for the stupid questions, I am trying to understand, not to criticize Rust :-) )
2024-01-30T12:35:30-0500	<MangoMan>	They look identical with my font
2024-01-30T12:36:07-0500	<lv8pv>	I wanted to watch a movie but my wife wanted to stay home. I wanted to listen to pink Floyd but my wife wanted to listen to music. So here I sitting in the sofa listening to Klingon Opera
2024-01-30T12:36:09-0500	<EvanR>	however the renderer works I got slightly different Ã's
2024-01-30T12:36:20-0500	<somercet>	hey
2024-01-30T12:37:24-0500	<hergertme_>	its fine, flatpak override --env=GSK_RENDERER to the rescue 
2024-01-30T12:37:52-0500	<orbifx>	lv8pv, at least she isn't wanting you to change the codebase to rust :P

2024-01-30T12:39:30-0500	<pj[m]>	but often it does
2024-01-30T12:40:00-0500	<pj[m]>	not the library but the applications change things so often
2024-01-30T12:51:38-0500	<consus>	jonesv: there is no maitainer at crate level
2024-01-30T12:52:56-0500	<consus>	jonesv: no one separately maintains sha256
2024-01-30T12:53:02-0500	<consus>	jonesv: the only package is foo
2024-01-30T12:53:31-0500	<consus>	for example, check https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/s390x/ripgrep
2024-01-30T12:54:21-0500	<consus>	ripgrep depends on a hell lot of crates, but none of them are alpine packages
2024-01-30T12:57:35-0500	<jonesv>	pj: How can an application break API compatibility with the library? It would just not build for the developer straight away, right?
2024-01-30T12:57:54-0500	<consus>	right
2024-01-30T12:58:01-0500	<consus>	if you're lucky :D
2024-01-30T12:58:19-0500	<consus>	however you can image this diff:
2024-01-30T12:58:31-0500	<consus>	- if (user == root)
2024-01-30T12:58:36-0500	<consus>	+ if (user != root)
2024-01-30T12:58:36-0500	<consus>	:D
2024-01-30T13:00:24-0500	<pj[m]>	jonesv: the same way application can work for developer and not work on alpine
2024-01-30T13:00:39-0500	<jonesv>	consus: "no one separately maintains sha256" -> but that's exactly what I mean: it removes the possibility for a maintainer of sha256, and sends the responsibility to all the executables that depend on it. So now the maintainer of foo needs to care about sha256, or just ignore it and let the CVEs pile up.
2024-01-30T13:01:04-0500	<consus>	nah
2024-01-30T13:01:08-0500	<consus>	it's much simpler
2024-01-30T13:01:08-0500	<jonesv>	pj: right, got it

2024-01-30T13:01:17-0500	<pj[m]>	maintainers still need to care about cve's thoughj
2024-01-30T13:01:25-0500	<consus>	it will show you the affected crates

2024-01-30T13:01:39-0500	<pj[m]>	the package has to be re-built for the new openssl for example
2024-01-30T13:02:16-0500	<consus>	not sure about that
2024-01-30T13:02:20-0500	<jonesv>	pj: you mean when changing from openssl1 to openssl3?
2024-01-30T13:02:25-0500	<consus>	major yes
2024-01-30T13:02:27-0500	<consus>	minor no
2024-01-30T13:02:55-0500	<consus>	well, "not always" as C abi is a fragile beast
2024-01-30T13:03:44-0500	<jonesv>	Well major means API break, right? So "maybe the maintainer has to fix the build, maybe they are lucky". Then an ABI break only means "soname changed -> needs to be recompiled", I guess?
2024-01-30T13:04:08-0500	<consus>	as with any other programs, yes
2024-01-30T13:04:28-0500	<consus>	api change might affect you or might not affect you
2024-01-30T13:04:43-0500	<pj[m]>	no, the package itself has to be rebuilt
2024-01-30T13:05:13-0500	<consus>	on abi change? yep, but maybe there will be more to that
2024-01-30T13:05:21-0500	<consus>	because api can also change :D
2024-01-30T13:05:29-0500	<consus>	and ffi won't be ready for that
2024-01-30T13:05:59-0500	<consus>	also some of transient dependencies can become a pain in the ass 
2024-01-30T13:06:21-0500	<jonesv>	Oh right, there's FFI on top of all that :). But FFI doesn't work with static linking at all, right?
2024-01-30T13:06:39-0500	<consus>	why not? it works with libc
2024-01-30T13:06:49-0500	<pj[m]>	jonesv: when changing from x.x.n to x.x.n+1 as well
2024-01-30T13:07:28-0500	<jonesv>	pj: why do you need to rebuild, if there is ABI and API compatibility?
2024-01-30T13:11:01-0500	<pj[m]>	well, soname could change
2024-01-30T13:11:26-0500	<consus>	on minor?
2024-01-30T13:11:40-0500	<pj[m]>	packages do weird stuff
2024-01-30T13:12:07-0500	<consus>	they certainly do
2024-01-30T13:12:35-0500	<consus>	but we are speaking about the usual workflow
2024-01-30T13:12:57-0500	<consus>	and libssl.so.3 won't be changing during the bugfix upgrade for example
2024-01-30T13:12:58-0500	<pj[m]>	there "should" not be need for rebuild
2024-01-30T13:13:01-0500	<pj[m]>	in such cases
2024-01-30T13:13:02-0500	<consus>	yep
2024-01-30T13:13:22-0500	<Anon_0000>	Hello! If I want to add ui I could use a file with builder ui definitions and add them with gtk_builder_new_from_file(). This is helpful, but I'm facing a problem: I'd like to dynamically add specific parts of the window. Imagine a sqlite3 database with the tables "table_1" and "table_2". I'd like to add ui elements for each of those tables (not necessarily the same elements though). Would I have to loop over the sqlite db and add the 
2024-01-30T13:13:22-0500	<Anon_0000>	ui with c code or could this be done with a .glade file as well (and then added with gtk_builder_add_from_file() i suppose)?
2024-01-30T13:13:24-0500	<consus>	I won't expect libssl soname change during the lifetime of an alpine release, for example
2024-01-30T13:14:06-0500	<Anon_0000>	Oh: These tables can be added / removed by the user.
2024-01-30T13:15:22-0500	<jonesv>	Right. So if API change (i.e. major changes): rebuild (and possibly fix the build). If SONAME changes: rebuild. Correct?
2024-01-30T13:15:49-0500	<Neui[m]>	You can load the ui file multiple times
2024-01-30T13:16:06-0500	<Neui[m]>	One for each table/tab
2024-01-30T13:16:35-0500	<pj[m]>	generally
2024-01-30T13:17:36-0500	<Anon_0000>	So I'd basically create one .glade file per valid table type and then add them with  gtk_builder_add_from_file()?
2024-01-30T13:46:05-0500	<Neui[m]>	I wouldnt use add but new builder instances

2024-01-31T02:08:28-0500	<bananicorn>	Hi, I wrote a little article about setting up alpine on an encrypted zfs dataset with UEFI boot via rEFInd, perhaps its interesting to some people here:

2024-01-31T02:08:51-0500	<bananicorn>	Please let me know any feedback or corrections :)
2024-01-31T02:45:55-0500	<leeward>	ifreund: It does seem obvious in retrospect, but since other bits of the hash map docs are explicit about invalidating things (iterators) I didn't think about it. I will open a PR when I get some free time; possibly tonight :)
2024-01-31T02:49:39-0500	<leeward>	I know I'm late to the party, but jacobly0 do you just want to use allocators idiomatically? Because things in the standard library just take an Allocator, not a *Allocator.
2024-01-31T03:01:44-0500	<ahmadraniri[m]>	like it.
2024-01-31T03:13:40-0500	<dok>	bananicorn: whats the advantage of using zfs over LUKS ?
2024-01-31T03:19:13-0500	<leeward>	Is there a Zon parser hiding somewhere in std? It seems like a convenient configuration format (nicer than JSON) but I don't see a library for it. Is build.zig just compiling the build.zig.zon file?
2024-01-31T03:37:27-0500	<bananicorn>	dok: I mentioned at the end I think, the main benefit for me is easy and fast snapshotting with low overhead
2024-01-31T03:37:59-0500	<dok>	okay, i must have skipped the end
2024-01-31T03:38:02-0500	<bananicorn>	And if you use two mirrored drives/partitions, you have some protection against corruption
2024-01-31T03:38:21-0500	<bananicorn>	with just a single disk it can only detect corruption but not fix it

2024-01-31T03:40:18-0500	<dok>	but do you also get the /boot encrypted?
2024-01-31T03:41:30-0500	<torque>	there's a work in progress PR for that https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/17731 but it is currently integrated directly into the compiler
2024-01-31T03:43:18-0500	<pj[m]>	ahmadraniri: because it's invalid
2024-01-31T03:43:41-0500	<pj[m]>	the correct pkgver is _gitXXXXX

2024-01-31T04:23:26-0500	<leeward>	I figured it was something like that, thanks.
2024-01-31T04:48:33-0500	<remiliascarlet>	andrewrk: Looks like I can't cross-compile the Zig compiler. Just `zig build` (on Linux) works, but `zig build -target x86_64-openbsd` and `zig build -target x86_64-freebsd` don't. Verified the same problem with `zig build -target x86_64-windows`, which I only did to verify whether it's an issue with just the BSD's not being supported or not.
2024-01-31T04:48:39-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Zig version is 0.12.0-dev.2341+92211135f.
2024-01-31T04:49:01-0500	<leeward>	Well, I guess this machine can't compile Zig. Took the whole thing out.

2024-01-31T04:59:36-0500	<ifreund>	remiliascarlet: this information is pretty useless without logs showing the error message you get
2024-01-31T04:59:37-0500	<leeward>	Or maybe it can if I tell it to only use one thread?
2024-01-31T05:01:48-0500	<leeward>	\o/ Ok, I can build Zig on this machine it just takes a little over 10 minutes.
2024-01-31T05:21:44-0500	<Onepamopa>	Hey guys.. quick question - when forking processes - is there a way to redirect each of their stdout to the read end of 1 separate process. I.e. say, 4 processes doing an identical task to be able to write to their stdout, and the 5th process to receive all of the writes to its stdin; and that process to write to it's stdout - and the 4 processes
2024-01-31T05:21:45-0500	<Onepamopa>	to receive the same "message" on their stdin's ?
2024-01-31T05:22:38-0500	<Onepamopa>	re**
2024-01-31T05:59:49-0500	<lv8pv>	What is the proper way to get user input, reading results from google often say scanf() but there are so many posts saying not to use it. Then some say gets() but my `man 3 gets` say its not in use.  I'm not writing anything that any user will ever use, just trying to learn and would love to do it the right way from the beginning.
2024-01-31T06:00:53-0500	<lv8pv>	Love to be pointed in the right direction for my google search =)
2024-01-31T06:09:20-0500	<bananicorn>	dok: Unfortunately no, /boot is not encrypted in this setup, I don't know if it's possible
2024-01-31T06:16:01-0500	<oldlaptop>	scanf()'s problem specifically is that it's trying to do two things (read input and perform various complicated substitutions on it) at once. In the standard library the two obvious choices are really the fgetc() family (single characters) and fgets() (a whole line at once, or as much of it as fits in the size you give it).
2024-01-31T06:16:35-0500	<oldlaptop>	(gets() is impossible to use safely because it leaves out the "as much of it as fits" part, meaning it can always overrun your buffer.)
2024-01-31T06:17:29-0500	<oldlaptop>	If you have GNU or recent POSIX, the getline() family may be of interest.
2024-01-31T06:18:12-0500	<oldlaptop>	If you want scanf()'s complicated processing, it's normally advisable to read the input in some other way first and then use sscanf().
2024-01-31T06:18:37-0500	<oldlaptop>	("substitutions" isn't quite right)
2024-01-31T06:19:48-0500	<uzz>	I'm just wondering why, if get() was removed, but gets() is considered insecure by GCC, why is it still allowed to be used?
2024-01-31T06:21:01-0500	<oldlaptop>	Its presence is required for conformance with older versions of the C standard.
2024-01-31T06:21:33-0500	<oldlaptop>	Some library implementations (OpenBSD's for example) really have completely removed it, and so it isn't "allowed to be used" on those systems.
2024-01-31T06:32:27-0500	<lv8pv>	oldlaptop: thank you so much =)
2024-01-31T06:47:06-0500	<frojnd>	I'm on 3.19, I just saw there is 3.19 is doing apk update && apk upgrade ok in this case?
2024-01-31T06:47:14-0500	<frojnd>	there is 3.19.1
2024-01-31T06:47:50-0500	<dok>	bananicorn: this possible, i think one option is to put a tiny linux in a boot rom have this decrypt the disk and continue the boot process
2024-01-31T06:49:21-0500	<dok>	(something else than grub)
2024-01-31T06:54:40-0500	<bananicorn>	dok: Right, I have heard of setups like this, that was a bit out of scope for me here :)
2024-01-31T06:55:23-0500	<dok>	but probably other options exists, i haven't search much
2024-01-31T06:55:43-0500	<bananicorn>	I've previously also had a setup that could be unlocked remotely with dropbear running in the initramfs, but I have not done this in a long time and don't know how to do it nicely with alpine

2024-01-31T07:20:10-0500	<tiotags>	you can create virtual fds to share when forking by using pipe and if you need to set stdout and stdin just copy the relevant fd via dup2
2024-01-31T07:22:36-0500	<fizzie>	The "broadcast" part of that question is not a thing, though. You can have the same pipe as the standard input of all four, but when you write some data to it, only one of them will manage to successfully read any given byte.
2024-01-31T07:22:56-0500	<fizzie>	(Of course you can have 4 different pipes and just write then same thing to all of them.)
2024-01-31T07:26:51-0500	<tiotags>	oh didn't read that he also wants the 4 processes to read something back
2024-01-31T07:27:23-0500	<frojnd>	Hm apk upgrade didn't ugprade to 3.19.1? Do I have to change content of /etc/apk/repositories from https://pkg.adfinis.com/alpine/v3.19/main to https://pkg.adfinis.com/alpine/v3.19.1/main and then update & upgrade ?
2024-01-31T07:29:54-0500	<tiotags>	though he can write to an anonymous file I guess and instead of reading he can wait for a file write event via something like inotify
2024-01-31T07:30:11-0500	<Company>	bah
2024-01-31T07:30:41-0500	<Company>	that "found it" was a lot less exciting than I thought

2024-01-31T07:36:20-0500	<ikke>	For existing installations, it suffices to run apk upgrade --update
2024-01-31T07:42:25-0500	<frojnd>	ikke: aha. Hm I couldn't find in apk-upgrade(8)

2024-01-31T08:53:03-0500	<uzz>	What is the policy for removal of deprecated APIs in GTK? I'm just wondering, because is being able to be compiled on the current verison of debian stable (In this case, 12 (bookworm)), a guarantee?
2024-01-31T08:53:41-0500	<feaneron>	deprecated apis are removed with every major version
2024-01-31T08:53:49-0500	<Company>	major versions break API, minor versions keep deprecated API working
2024-01-31T08:53:52-0500	<uzz>	Major version as in 4->5?
2024-01-31T08:54:01-0500	<Company>	yes
2024-01-31T08:54:14-0500	<uzz>	Then I have nothing to worry about then with debian stable. :)
2024-01-31T08:54:35-0500	<Company>	minor versions add API, so if you rely on stuff from 4.12 it will not work with 4.10
2024-01-31T08:54:36-0500	<grawity>	debian stable being debian stable, it's probably not going to switch even minor versions all that much... (and they'd probably patch the features in anyway, I've seen them do that)
2024-01-31T08:54:58-0500	<Company>	but everything written against 4.12 will work with any 4.x version
2024-01-31T08:55:20-0500	<seninha>	Hi. If I have a `struct {int left, right} *p;` and an `int arr[LEN];`, if I set `p = (void *)arr;` then `&p[n] == &arr[n*2]' forall n?
2024-01-31T08:55:22-0500	<seninha>	Or is that UB or the compiler can somehow add leading dummy bytes to the struct's size?
2024-01-31T08:55:28-0500	<uzz>	I'll avoid stuff that is only available in newer versions of GTK4, to avoid issues with it working on debian stable. Thank you.
2024-01-31T08:55:49-0500	<Onepamopa>	so, theres no way to use pipe() & dup/dup2 to have 4 stdouts passed to 1 stdin, and 1 stdin - to 4 stdouts ?
2024-01-31T08:55:58-0500	<Company>	uzz: there's macros you cn define that cause compiler warnings if you use stuff that you consider too new
2024-01-31T08:56:17-0500	<seninha>	https://termbin.com/zydo
2024-01-31T08:56:59-0500	<Company>	I don't remember how that works, but it is documented in the versioning stuff somewhere
2024-01-31T08:57:29-0500	<Ankhers>	Does anyone know when the zig showtime 2024 roadmap episode will be made available?
2024-01-31T08:59:29-0500	<fizzie>	Onepamopa: The former, no; the latter, yes. "Multiple writers, single reader" works fine-ish with a single pipe (with caveats: if the writes are large, they can get interleaved), but "single writer, multiple readers" doesn't (if you want all the readers to be able to read the same thing).
2024-01-31T09:01:15-0500	<fizzie>	seninha: There's no padding at the *beginning* of the struct, but that doesn't really help in your case, because padding anywhere will break that idea. (It's also UB for effective-type-related reasons.)
2024-01-31T09:01:56-0500	<chair1>	seninha: casting pointer to the "wrong" type is UB in standard C
2024-01-31T09:03:23-0500	<jacobly0>	It is available https://youtu.be/5eL_LcxwwHg
2024-01-31T09:03:46-0500	<alatiera>	where 4.x >= 4.12
2024-01-31T09:04:06-0500	<chair1>	but let's say that some compiler extension permits it... this struct may not have padding, you can ensure it by using _Static_assert() and _Alignof macros
2024-01-31T09:04:32-0500	<chair1>	actually, none are macros, anyway
2024-01-31T09:05:44-0500	<uzz>	As long as I can keep using this on debian stable, I don't particuarly have any need for bleeding edge stuff, I'll be a happy camper.
2024-01-31T09:12:09-0500	<seninha>	i see
2024-01-31T09:13:55-0500	<zcrayfish>	https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Developers <-- wonder if any of these guys still accept donations? ;)
2024-01-31T09:14:21-0500	<chair1>	OOP fans love to cast pointers, and some big projects rely on it, so I guess all compilers support casting to some extent
2024-01-31T09:14:44-0500	<seninha>	Casting `int *` to `struct{int;int;}*` is a different issue than incrementing `struct{int;int;} *p` and expect it to point to `arr+2`, isn't it?
2024-01-31T09:15:03-0500	<seninha>	Are both of those UB?
2024-01-31T09:16:00-0500	<seninha>	btw, i compiled https://termbin.com/zydo with clang's -fsanitize=undefined,alignment an could run it ok
2024-01-31T09:16:35-0500	<chair1>	the compiler will only destroy you with -O2. unless you pass -fno-strict-aliasing
2024-01-31T09:19:59-0500	<seninha>	Here I eliminate the second issue by reassigning p at each iterationg (rather than considering it an array and accessing its elements): https://termbin.com/ok3u
2024-01-31T09:20:22-0500	<seninha>	chair1, still fine with -O2
2024-01-31T09:21:23-0500	<fizzie>	Just *converting* `int *` to `struct { int a, b; } *` is a case of C11 6.3.2.3p7: "A pointer to an object type may be converted to a pointer to a different object type. If the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the referenced type, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, when converted back again, the result shall compare equal to the original pointer."
2024-01-31T09:21:28-0500	<chair1>	undefined doesn't mean it will always blow up in incredible ways
2024-01-31T09:21:44-0500	<fizzie>	(Reading a value through that converted pointer is a different matter, though.)
2024-01-31T09:21:58-0500	<chair1>	very curious
2024-01-31T09:23:37-0500	<fizzie>	For reading (or writing) using a pointer of the "wrong type", the rule that usually comes up is 6.5p7, the "effective type" / "strict aliasing" rule.
2024-01-31T09:24:15-0500	<chair1>	in my head only reading/writing to something cast to char* is safe lol
2024-01-31T09:24:49-0500	<chair1>	I'll read these paragraphs, thanks

2024-01-31T09:32:50-0500	<ikke>	There you see the last commit to linux-lts before 3.19.1 was tagged 
2024-01-31T09:33:17-0500	<Company>	I got that it was a much bigger deal for you, because you were so confused about it
2024-01-31T09:33:31-0500	<Company>	I'm just exhausted with everything anyway
2024-01-31T09:34:57-0500	<mclasen>	oh, yeah, it is very exhausting
2024-01-31T09:35:20-0500	<mclasen>	but you noticed how now, that we have a new renderer, the font rendering of the old renderer has become the gold standard?
2024-01-31T09:37:57-0500	<Company>	it hasn't really
2024-01-31T09:38:14-0500	<Company>	(also, old and new renderer are identical)
2024-01-31T09:38:43-0500	<Company>	what has happened is that we've been investigating font rendering due to the clipping glitch and finidng out things
2024-01-31T09:39:28-0500	<Company>	also, I just told Sophie I don't want to cause resizes on monitor changes
2024-01-31T09:39:47-0500	<Company>	that also should apply to our font settings
2024-01-31T09:40:14-0500	<Company>	and another question I had:
2024-01-31T09:40:31-0500	<Company>	How is font stuff supposed to work on fractional scaling?
2024-01-31T09:41:16-0500	<Company>	like, on 150% you want to hint to every 1.5th pixel or so? Round glyph positions towards that? How is that even meant to work?
2024-01-31T09:41:45-0500	<Company>	what does that mean for keming?
2024-01-31T09:43:33-0500	<lb90>	Company: on Windows there are no virtual coordinates
2024-01-31T09:43:51-0500	<lb90>	You only ever work with physical pixels, period
2024-01-31T09:43:56-0500	<somercet>	Probably like scrollbars, you use doubles to map it out, and then reduce to actual pixels.
2024-01-31T09:44:15-0500	<lb90>	In a certain sense that has many advantages
2024-01-31T09:44:30-0500	<lb90>	Virtual coordinates are only used in apps that are not DPI aware
2024-01-31T09:44:38-0500	<Company>	Winamp is smaller than my headerbar
2024-01-31T09:45:11-0500	<lb90>	Yeah, scaling things right is still an hard thing
2024-01-31T09:45:28-0500	<Company>	https://i.imgur.com/2RGbF3E.png
2024-01-31T09:45:29-0500	<lb90>	But OTOH when you draw text or position things you are in control of actual pixels
2024-01-31T09:45:31-0500	<Company>	it's really cute
2024-01-31T09:46:00-0500	<lb90>	It's menifesting as DPI aware when it really isn't :)
2024-01-31T09:47:05-0500	<Company>	I think it's a good idea to have a global scale toggle
2024-01-31T09:47:24-0500	<Company>	it just falls apart in the few cases where you do care about physical pixels
2024-01-31T09:47:40-0500	<Company>	because you can't really have both
2024-01-31T09:47:46-0500	<Company>	without a *TON* of work
2024-01-31T09:47:52-0500	<Company>	and nobody is gonna do that work
2024-01-31T09:47:53-0500	<lb90>	Company: right
2024-01-31T09:48:45-0500	<lb90>	Company: how do browsers like FF deal with that?
2024-01-31T09:48:59-0500	<lb90>	Do they even try to hint text?
2024-01-31T09:49:32-0500	<Company>	text is always the one special case people spend time on
2024-01-31T09:49:55-0500	<Company>	so what they usually do is track if they arae aligned with the pixel grid and if so, they hint the text
2024-01-31T09:50:39-0500	<Company>	you can often see it glitching if you make an animation that does a slight transform (say rotate by 0.0000001 degrees or offset by 0.00001px)
2024-01-31T09:50:49-0500	<mclasen>	Company: hinting is about aligning to the pixel grid
2024-01-31T09:51:10-0500	<mclasen>	for hinting to make sense, your font rasterizer needs to know where the pixels are
2024-01-31T09:52:10-0500	<Company>	yeah, I was thinking about hinting vs positioning
2024-01-31T09:52:42-0500	<Company>	because if positioning doesn't place the glyphs properly, hinting doesn't help
2024-01-31T09:54:08-0500	<Company>	but positioning depending on scale factor means that you need to reposition when scale changes
2024-01-31T09:54:14-0500	<Company>	and I don't think we do that
2024-01-31T09:54:38-0500	<Company>	also, if positioning influences size, then scale factor changes could cause a resize
2024-01-31T09:54:57-0500	<Company>	and then your text reflows when you move your window to the other monitor
2024-01-31T09:55:05-0500	<Company>	and you don't want that to ever happen
2024-01-31T09:55:13-0500	<mclasen>	I think we discussed before that anything in the subpixel range can safely be ignored for sizing
2024-01-31T09:55:29-0500	<Company>	"My Word document is a page longer on the big monitor"
2024-01-31T09:56:09-0500	<Company>	yeah, I'm just pointing out the slippery slope this all is
2024-01-31T09:57:01-0500	<lb90>	mclasen: I get an error when compiling GTK (main branch) on Windows: undefined reference to gtk_printer_find()
2024-01-31T09:57:11-0500	<lb90>	from gtkprintdialog.c
2024-01-31T09:57:29-0500	<lb90>	It seems that GtkPrinter is Unix-only
2024-01-31T09:57:42-0500	<lb90>	Should I implement it also on Windows?
2024-01-31T09:58:03-0500	<mclasen>	dunno, somebody needs to touch printing on Windows
2024-01-31T09:58:09-0500	<mclasen>	but it isn't me
2024-01-31T09:58:32-0500	<lb90>	mclasen: I have a question, regarding that
2024-01-31T09:58:35-0500	<mclasen>	what is really needed is an implementation of the printdialog functionality for Windows
2024-01-31T09:59:23-0500	<mclasen>	because the one in gtkprintdialog.c only talks to the print portal
2024-01-31T09:59:24-0500	<lb90>	Is GtkPrintDialog supposed to print PDF files?
2024-01-31T09:59:46-0500	<mclasen>	yes, that is basically what it does
2024-01-31T09:59:56-0500	<lb90>	If so, we'd have to depend on GhostScript on Windows
2024-01-31T10:00:14-0500	<mclasen>	Windows can't print pdf files ?
2024-01-31T10:00:22-0500	<lb90>	Uhm nope :/
2024-01-31T10:00:30-0500	<mclasen>	shocker
2024-01-31T10:00:37-0500	<lb90>	A few printers understand PDF natively, others don't
2024-01-31T10:00:56-0500	<lb90>	Windows supports XPS natively
2024-01-31T10:01:12-0500	<lb90>	so you can print any XPS on any printer, but not so with PDF :/
2024-01-31T10:06:13-0500	<mclasen>	if printing xps files works better, then maybe that is what the print dialog should do on windows
2024-01-31T10:06:28-0500	<lm->	I think char * can alias any type, not sure if editing it is safe tho
2024-01-31T10:06:33-0500	<mclasen>	just need to add some way to differentiate between pdf and xps
2024-01-31T10:06:57-0500	<lb90>	All right :)
2024-01-31T10:07:12-0500	<lm->	the other way around is not legal, but whole embedded world is still doing things like 'char buf[128]; read(buf); struct data *data = buf' :]
2024-01-31T10:09:01-0500	<lm->	with that you must use `-fno-strict-aliasing', which will cost you some performance, but I suppose on small chips ram is more precious then clock
2024-01-31T10:16:07-0500	<Ankhers>	jacobly0: Thanks. I must have missed it on their channel.
2024-01-31T10:26:57-0500	<leeward>	I just realized that Loris didn't tell us to subscribe or click the bell. So refreshing.
2024-01-31T10:30:48-0500	<itu>	  hi
2024-01-31T10:31:13-0500	<itu>	how to disable opening hexchat more than once?
2024-01-31T10:32:39-0500	<itu>	in ubuntu
2024-01-31T10:44:58-0500	<mclasen>	Company: If you want to inject topics for the hackfest, we are starting to assemble here
2024-01-31T10:47:14-0500	<mclasen>	Also, another day, another funny bug: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6388
2024-01-31T10:48:22-0500	<Company>	that looks like someone forgot to clear the buffer of the first frame
2024-01-31T10:48:43-0500	<Company>	and because the shadow doesn't change, every other redraw gets it reused
2024-01-31T10:50:37-0500	<sney>	itu: make sure your shortcut or however you are launching hexchat always uses the -e / --existing option 
2024-01-31T10:53:03-0500	<mclasen>	sounds plausible
2024-01-31T10:53:18-0500	<Company>	it alos looks like it's 2 tiles
2024-01-31T10:53:27-0500	<Company>	64x32 or 128x64 or so
2024-01-31T10:57:22-0500	<itu>	i just tested -e from cli and it opened a second hexchat  ...
2024-01-31T10:58:25-0500	<sney>	are you in wayland? the -e checker probably depends on some legacy xorg thing 
2024-01-31T10:59:21-0500	<itu>	ubuntu 22.4 , gnome , not sure if it is wayland
2024-01-31T10:59:44-0500	<sney>	gnome defaults to wayland for some time now 
2024-01-31T11:02:32-0500	<Company>	512x128
2024-01-31T11:02:35-0500	<Company>	I checked
2024-01-31T11:06:00-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Ankhers: I saw it, but not too much interesting stuff this time, mostly just financial stuff. Maybe we'll get the major stuff during the Milan event.
2024-01-31T11:06:24-0500	<itu>	ok, no simple solution, thanks anyway
2024-01-31T11:07:41-0500	<sney>	there might be something in the systemd .desktop spec that can check for duplicates when you launch 
2024-01-31T11:08:37-0500	<Ankhers>	I haven't been able to finish it yet. I was hoping to get an understanding of what was going on. I am trying to decide if I want to learn Zig as my next language.
2024-01-31T11:09:48-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I'd say, give the Ziglings excercises a try, and make a decision based on that.
2024-01-31T11:11:08-0500	<remiliascarlet>	And also understand the type of programs you want to make. If you want to make games, then certainly Zig is a great language. But if you want to make web-based backends, then maybe Go is a better fit.
2024-01-31T11:11:10-0500	<Ankhers>	Thanks. I will take a look through that. I started going through zig.guide, but it didn't really feel like what I needed.
2024-01-31T11:11:42-0500	<Ankhers>	I have been using Elixir for the last almost 10 years. I am good for the web backend stuff.
2024-01-31T11:12:46-0500	<Ankhers>	I did want a language more in line to build something closer to a desktop app.
2024-01-31T11:13:04-0500	<Company>	mclasen: one thing that might be interesting to discuss with people present is the Mesa story
2024-01-31T11:13:04-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I was going to give you the link to the repository, but it looks like Codeberg is currently broken.
2024-01-31T11:13:14-0500	<remiliascarlet>	So once they fix it: https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises
2024-01-31T11:13:44-0500	<Ankhers>	It seems to work for me.
2024-01-31T11:13:50-0500	<remiliascarlet>	"desktop app" A desktop is not an iPhone.
2024-01-31T11:14:07-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Yeah, now it works for me too.
2024-01-31T11:14:18-0500	<Company>	I filed https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-build-meta/-/issues/791 recently
2024-01-31T11:14:36-0500	<Ankhers>	Yes. I was also thinking of tinkering with mobile development with it. I have done stuff in cpp and rust for mobile development (nothing game related). So I thought I would try that again for a new project I hope to work on.
2024-01-31T11:15:12-0500	<Company>	and I have no clue what the opinion is on moving our development integrate closer with Mesa and not just treat it as an external dependency
2024-01-31T11:15:18-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I've never done mobile development, I hate smartphones.
2024-01-31T11:15:34-0500	<Ankhers>	Me too, but other people can't get off of them...
2024-01-31T11:15:53-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Then don't feed the beast.
2024-01-31T11:16:49-0500	<remiliascarlet>	The more we move from desktop and/or web browsers to smartphones, the more we lose the freedom of platforms.
2024-01-31T11:19:04-0500	<remiliascarlet>	I'd be more OK with smartphones if we'd go from desktop + web to desktop + web + mobile. But instead we're increasingly going from desktop + web to mobile-only.
2024-01-31T11:19:43-0500	<Ankhers>	Yeah. That is not generally the approach that I take. But I completely get what you are saying.
2024-01-31T11:28:50-0500	<mclasen>	Company: ok
2024-01-31T11:28:57-0500	<mclasen>	I'll bring it up at some point
2024-01-31T11:31:16-0500	<Company>	mclasen: oh, and discussing if we need to switch back to the old renderer
2024-01-31T11:31:38-0500	<Company>	worth getting more opinions on that
2024-01-31T11:32:44-0500	<mclasen>	good idea
2024-01-31T11:45:25-0500	<AmeliaMonaldo>	Come to Tel.gram if you have free sex with me >> @mariyaccxx
2024-01-31T11:45:37-0500	<AmeliaMonaldo>	Come to Tel.gram if you have free sex with me >> @mariyaccxx
2024-01-31T11:47:50-0500	<Company>	mclasen: another evergreen topic is testsuite - but I think the wrong people for that topic are there
2024-01-31T11:48:11-0500	<Company>	mainly: getting Windows and Mac CI to run the testsuite
2024-01-31T11:48:13-0500	<mclasen>	I have the right people here to talk about a11y and input testing
2024-01-31T11:48:17-0500	<Company>	and getting Ubuntu etc test runners
2024-01-31T11:48:36-0500	<Company>	that's an interesting thing, too
2024-01-31T11:49:12-0500	<Company>	your input rendernode line in the Agenda made me wonder about rendernode equivalents for a11y
2024-01-31T11:49:30-0500	<Ankhers>	Does anyone know if there is something already built to get a development version of zig in nix? I can build it out myself if nothing currently exists.
2024-01-31T11:50:26-0500	<Company>	ie having a text format that fully describes a11y state of a widget (tree)
2024-01-31T11:52:04-0500	<alatiera>	Company: what;s the ubuntu specific part
2024-01-31T11:55:15-0500	<braewoods_>	Ankhers, are you asking for essentially for a nightly build repository for some Linux distribution?
2024-01-31T11:55:35-0500	<braewoods_>	s/for essentially//
2024-01-31T11:56:05-0500	<Ankhers>	braewoods_: Yes. I was just wondering if someone else had already done the work for the nix package manager.
2024-01-31T11:57:19-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Ankhers: Simply download the archive for Linux, extract it, put it somewhere, configure your $PATH variable to it, and you're good to go.
2024-01-31T11:57:24-0500	<remiliascarlet>	No need to compile anything.
2024-01-31T11:57:45-0500	<Ankhers>	That doesn't really work on nixos. You can't download and run arbitrary binaries.
2024-01-31T11:57:52-0500	<Ankhers>	I could patch the binary though.
2024-01-31T11:58:06-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Sounds like a hopeless distro then.
2024-01-31T11:59:00-0500	<Company>	alatiera: I'd like to catch https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6383 in CI
2024-01-31T11:59:07-0500	<Ankhers>	To each their own.
2024-01-31T11:59:17-0500	<Company>	and not in the packages builder
2024-01-31T11:59:50-0500	<Company>	also because we can then tell the packages people "this is the settings we use to run the testsuite on Ubuntu"
2024-01-31T12:00:00-0500	<Company>	but all our CI runners are Fedora
2024-01-31T12:00:24-0500	<alatiera>	is that casused by different package versions?
2024-01-31T12:01:42-0500	<JanC>	sney: I would think it uses dbus, as it already uses that for other things...?
2024-01-31T12:02:09-0500	<Company>	alatiera: is what caused by different package versions?
2024-01-31T12:02:16-0500	<alatiera>	for librsvg I've added recently tests against nightly and against the last gnome runtime version
2024-01-31T12:02:26-0500	<alatiera>	the difference in the tests above in the issue
2024-01-31T12:02:39-0500	<alatiera>	I can't tell what causes it by skimming it
2024-01-31T12:02:56-0500	<Company>	alatiera: the bottommost comment hasmy analysis
2024-01-31T12:03:04-0500	<Company>	with the 2 comparison images
2024-01-31T12:03:37-0500	<Company>	so I suspect it's a Mesa configuration difference that causes Ubuntu's software renderer to be less accurate
2024-01-31T12:03:42-0500	<Company>	probably for perf reasons
2024-01-31T12:04:12-0500	*	ralothar7 is now known as ralothar
2024-01-31T12:04:12-0500	*	slomo7 is now known as slomo
2024-01-31T12:04:28-0500	<alatiera>	that kind of stuff you can't catch in CI
2024-01-31T12:04:38-0500	<alatiera>	cause it's integration territory is N distros
2024-01-31T12:04:48-0500	<alatiera>	it's like that firefox bug
2024-01-31T12:05:11-0500	<Company>	well, you can catch it in CI and then decide what to do about it
2024-01-31T12:05:21-0500	<alatiera>	it will make changing the tests very hard if you have more than 1 reference outputs
2024-01-31T12:05:22-0500	<Company>	which may be disabling the test
2024-01-31T12:05:32-0500	<Company>	or making Ubuntu use different flags in their Mesa compile
2024-01-31T12:05:34-0500	*	Exagone313 is now known as Exa
2024-01-31T12:05:34-0500	*	Exagone313 is now known as Exa
2024-01-31T12:05:34-0500	*	Exagone313 is now known as Exa
2024-01-31T12:05:34-0500	*	Exagone313 is now known as Exa
2024-01-31T12:05:34-0500	*	Exagone313 is now known as Exa
2024-01-31T12:05:59-0500	<Company>	but you can actually decide it together with Ubuntu people
2024-01-31T12:06:32-0500	<alatiera>	sure you can give them something for reference
2024-01-31T12:06:43-0500	<alatiera>	but not sure it's doable to add it in the CI
2024-01-31T12:07:03-0500	<alatiera>	this kind of thing happened all the time in librsvg with text rendering
2024-01-31T12:07:08-0500	<Company>	sure
2024-01-31T12:07:16-0500	<alatiera>	cause there was a suse, an ubuntu and a fedora build
2024-01-31T12:07:20-0500	<Company>	but we're trying to figure out ways to handle that
2024-01-31T12:07:27-0500	<alatiera>	and all had different cairo/pango versions
2024-01-31T12:07:38-0500	<Company>	and and if we have multiple builds we know what to do about it
2024-01-31T12:08:05-0500	<Company>	of coruse that requires somebody actually interested in making it work
2024-01-31T12:08:15-0500	<Company>	but it might just be that this is a bug in Ubuntu
2024-01-31T12:08:17-0500	<alatiera>	eventually it ended up "Here are the version federico has on his machine an the tests on CI work with those too"
2024-01-31T12:08:36-0500	<Company>	and Ubuntu has shitty software rendering because they misconfigure their Mesa
2024-01-31T12:08:53-0500	<Company>	yeah, but it doesn't have to be like that
2024-01-31T12:09:27-0500	<alatiera>	it has if you want to continue with upstream development
2024-01-31T12:09:44-0500	<alatiera>	cause otherwise you are fixing distro bugs that don't exist
2024-01-31T12:09:58-0500	<Company>	well sure
2024-01-31T12:10:10-0500	<Company>	I'm not just gonna fix random distro bugs
2024-01-31T12:10:37-0500	<Company>	but if there's cooperation, I'm very much interested in making my testsuite work better
2024-01-31T12:10:39-0500	<somercet>	JanC, yeah, it uses dbus
2024-01-31T12:10:46-0500	<alatiera>	sure
2024-01-31T12:11:12-0500	<Company>	but step one of such a cooperation would be having an Ubuntu runner
2024-01-31T12:11:24-0500	<Company>	even if we make it turn off half the testsuite
2024-01-31T12:11:39-0500	<alatiera>	just saying that the amount of false positive and differenceis for other issues will be higher than the one off missconfiguration you will find
2024-01-31T12:11:50-0500	<Company>	I mean, GTK developers all run Fedora, that's not the best monoculture
2024-01-31T12:12:08-0500	<alatiera>	it is when you need a reference system
2024-01-31T12:12:37-0500	<Company>	I already make Vulkan and GL and Cairo run
2024-01-31T12:12:51-0500	<Company>	I know about the pain of dealing with differences...
2024-01-31T12:13:05-0500	<alatiera>	yea but you are in control of those
2024-01-31T12:13:29-0500	<Company>	yeah, but I'm also in control of Ubuntu - or at least that'd be the goal
2024-01-31T12:13:55-0500	<alatiera>	go for it
2024-01-31T12:14:00-0500	<alatiera>	can't be worse than Mark
2024-01-31T12:14:26-0500	<JanC>	I think -e requires an URL or a command
2024-01-31T12:20:01-0500	<hergertme>	im getting clipped fonts even for GtkInscription and fractional scaling btw 
2024-01-31T12:20:09-0500	<hergertme>	so i think it's deeper than just the VTE thing 
2024-01-31T12:20:35-0500	<alatiera>	speaking off, feaneron you mentioned a shell bug with input getting stolen the other day?
2024-01-31T12:20:41-0500	<hergertme>	what is strange is when it's not even on the fractional scaling monitor 
2024-01-31T12:20:51-0500	<alatiera>	got a link? cause if not I will file a prompt issue
2024-01-31T12:21:15-0500	<feaneron>	alatiera: yes. something related to grabs, i haven't been able to figure out yet
2024-01-31T12:21:34-0500	<feaneron>	i don't have an issue or anything for that though, perhaps someone else filed an issue for that?
2024-01-31T12:22:03-0500	<alatiera>	will find out, gonna grab a coffee and look
2024-01-31T12:22:20-0500	<feaneron>	thanks
2024-01-31T12:22:45-0500	<feaneron>	Company: what would be closer to gtk_widget_is_toplevel() - GTK_IS_ROOT() or GTK_IS_NATIVE()?
2024-01-31T12:26:15-0500	<Company>	feaneron: depends - root is the toplevel, ie GtkWindow, native also includes popovers (or menus or combobox dropdowns or...)
2024-01-31T12:26:46-0500	<feaneron>	hm, okay
2024-01-31T12:26:53-0500	<feaneron>	i think i want root then
2024-01-31T12:27:11-0500	<feaneron>	thanks for explaining that, i wasn't aware of this difference
2024-01-31T12:28:50-0500	<JanC>	it seems like passing an empty URL ("") works
2024-01-31T12:29:46-0500	<Company>	root is called that because it's the root - the widget that doesn't have a parent
2024-01-31T12:29:58-0500	<Company>	native is called native, because it has a native GdkSurface
2024-01-31T12:30:10-0500	<Company>	in case that helps :)
2024-01-31T12:32:37-0500	<JanC>	so the Exec line in the .desktop file could be Â«Exec=hexchat --existing "%U"Â» instead of Â«Exec=hexchat --existing %UÂ»

2024-01-31T12:37:44-0500	<KillerWasp>	hello, where i can find details about sockaddr_in in man pages?
2024-01-31T12:39:57-0500	<KillerWasp>	or all details for each family?
2024-01-31T12:40:07-0500	<KillerWasp>	family of sockaddr*
2024-01-31T12:44:47-0500	<LeoNerd>	ip(7)
2024-01-31T12:46:45-0500	<KillerWasp>	LeoNerd: thanks. the details are very hide. :(
2024-01-31T12:47:38-0500	<LeoNerd>	Yes there's a lot of manpage-related docs that rely on you knowing where the docs are
2024-01-31T12:47:45-0500	<LeoNerd>	Discoverability is a real problem
2024-01-31T12:47:48-0500	<omegatron>	well, not a man page, but there is also  https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Internet-Address-Formats.html
2024-01-31T12:48:13-0500	<KillerWasp>	i can see the list of family in socket(2), but here only show the family detail, not the structure of each one used for sockaddr.
2024-01-31T12:50:49-0500	<KillerWasp>	i found this also, that not's a man page:
2024-01-31T12:50:51-0500	<KillerWasp>	https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/sockaddr_in
2024-01-31T12:51:24-0500	<KillerWasp>	have two variables more, len and zero, i guess that this only exist in apple.
2024-01-31T12:51:59-0500	<omegatron>	kernel data types are not necessarily the same as data types in some c library implementation
2024-01-31T12:53:47-0500	<omegatron>	apple put this stuff into public headers, because you may want to implement some IOKit software (aka kernel module), which has nothing to do with glibc or apple's implemenation as libSystem
2024-01-31T12:55:53-0500	<omegatron>	and yes, it's an issue to some extent, that some datatypes have the same designation, despite their origin and use ; hence you always have to include the correct header files and therefore also search in the correct man/doc resources
2024-01-31T12:59:53-0500	*	the_mariner1 is now known as the_mariner
2024-01-31T13:02:56-0500	<itu>	hmm
2024-01-31T13:08:35-0500	<itu>	where is .desktop  ?

2024-01-31T13:13:45-0500	<JanC>	itu: /usr/share/applications/io.github.Hexchat.desktop (you have to copy that into ~/.local/share/applications/ before changing it)
2024-01-31T13:15:35-0500	<sney>	hm if -e is only for urls then why is it in the default launcher? drag and drop? 
2024-01-31T13:15:53-0500	<somercet>	so it does come out the top
2024-01-31T13:16:00-0500	<bananicorn>	Wow, today i learned that "apk version" exists - I always used "apk -s upgrade" thinking that's the only way
2024-01-31T13:16:14-0500	<somercet>	okay, another idea
2024-01-31T13:16:40-0500	<somercet>	other than a 17mm deep well
2024-01-31T13:17:05-0500	<JanC>	for when you launch an irc:/ircs: URL
2024-01-31T13:17:26-0500	<JanC>	that's what the %U is a placeholder for
2024-01-31T13:18:24-0500	<JanC>	-e is also for commands (-c/--command) BTW
2024-01-31T13:18:32-0500	<sney>	ah, gotcha
2024-01-31T13:18:50-0500	<JanC>	which allows you to send IRC commands to the running instance
2024-01-31T13:22:14-0500	<KillerWasp>	thanks by the help. maybe i must find all the structures in the header files of the kernel.
2024-01-31T13:22:43-0500	<omegatron>	are you sure you want the kernel datatypes and not those of some c library implementation !?
2024-01-31T13:26:05-0500	<KillerWasp>	omegatron: what c library implementation? theqt header files?
2024-01-31T13:27:15-0500	<quinq>	nice
2024-01-31T13:27:33-0500	<KillerWasp>	exist something other apart of the kernel?
2024-01-31T13:29:25-0500	<omegatron>	kernel != c library  ; there are various available:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations
2024-01-31T13:29:40-0500	<omegatron>	are you writing software for mac os x?
2024-01-31T13:31:29-0500	<itu>	ok, looks like this work   (with having to re/start hexchat via cli, which i usual do)
2024-01-31T13:31:45-0500	<itu>	thx JanC 
2024-01-31T13:31:54-0500	<omegatron>	if you do and use apple's implementation, it's libSystem.dylib anyway, which you can find at https://opensource.apple.com/releases/  or https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Libsystem

2024-01-31T13:32:36-0500	<JanC>	so Â«hexchat -e ""Â» then
2024-01-31T13:34:56-0500	<KillerWasp>	omegatron: no, i'm programming for linux.
2024-01-31T13:35:59-0500	<KillerWasp>	like i understand, all are from the headers of kernel, like 'inux' or 'bits' directories.
2024-01-31T13:36:08-0500	<KillerWasp>	'linux'*
2024-01-31T13:36:40-0500	<omegatron>	.. aaand, I assume you don't write something kernel-related, but some high-level stuff, which you will link with the gnu libc (aka glibc) ?
2024-01-31T13:37:12-0500	<omegatron>	no, if you want to know, which directories in /usr/include are populated with linux kernel headers, you could, for example, see the list at  https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter05/linux-headers.html
2024-01-31T13:40:04-0500	<omegatron>	and glibc's include directories are listed here: https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter08/glibc.html
2024-01-31T13:40:41-0500	*	lisbeths_ is now known as lisbeths
2024-01-31T13:44:33-0500	<KillerWasp>	omegatron: ok, all are from the glibc, which's the headers that i used actually for AF_INET, i use from the kernel headers for AF_PACKET, which have options of more low details.
2024-01-31T14:15:04-0500	<hergertme>	this whole calling this dialog stuff bottom sheets is such a missed opportunity to call them window drapes 
2024-01-31T14:15:22-0500	*	hergertme still feels like client side dialogs is going to bite us in the arse though 
2024-01-31T14:26:49-0500	<LeoNerd>	I think procmail has broken my mail setup and I don't know how to fix it
2024-01-31T14:27:21-0500	<LeoNerd>	.. er.. wrong chat
2024-01-31T14:34:23-0500	<Company>	I'm more surprised that dialogs have come back
2024-01-31T14:34:35-0500	<Company>	like, we spent the 2010s getting rid of modal dialogs
2024-01-31T14:34:46-0500	<Company>	and now we're excitedly bringing them back
2024-01-31T14:35:10-0500	<Company>	i'll wait for the year of the menu
2024-01-31T14:35:44-0500	<hergertme>	im not a fan of modal personally 
2024-01-31T14:35:52-0500	<hergertme>	and it's one of my biggest gripes about it
2024-01-31T14:36:04-0500	<hergertme>	im also not a fan of sacrificing desktops at the alter of mobile 
2024-01-31T14:36:19-0500	<hergertme>	not that you can't do both, just that there is no expectation that both are the same 
2024-01-31T14:36:50-0500	<hergertme>	though the recent mutter fix to place transient-for non-modals on their parent is a godsend 
2024-01-31T14:43:57-0500	*	Red_ is now known as Red

2024-01-31T14:46:52-0500	<poprocks>	I remember when Android had a dedicated 'menu' button. I thought it was pretty cool. But it doesn't seem to be a UX users demand

2024-01-31T14:53:31-0500	<Company>	I think apps today are boring
2024-01-31T14:53:43-0500	<Company>	so I don't care how they are made
2024-01-31T14:53:51-0500	<Company>	it's either just a bunch of next button
2024-01-31T14:53:59-0500	<Company>	withs elections
2024-01-31T14:54:06-0500	<Company>	or a long form
2024-01-31T14:54:41-0500	<Company>	give me UIs where it's beneficial to rearrange the elements and where you can combine stuff by dragging them over each oter
2024-01-31T14:54:53-0500	<Company>	and make that intuitive
2024-01-31T14:54:53-0500	<hergertme>	sounds like Next
2024-01-31T14:55:10-0500	<hergertme>	fwiw i do want some of that if i ever can get back to Drafting 
2024-01-31T14:55:11-0500	<Company>	dunno, I never used NExt
2024-01-31T14:55:11-0500	<poprocks>	"download the app for a better experience!" --> ::download app:: --> just a webpage wrapped in a paper-thin UI
2024-01-31T14:55:15-0500	<hergertme>	esp for building data apps 
2024-01-31T14:55:50-0500	<Company>	my favorite UI currently is After Effects
2024-01-31T14:55:50-0500	<hergertme>	i need to revamp Gom but i also want to have basically a "libtables" which is all the listmodel'y stuff i did in Sysprof 
2024-01-31T14:56:15-0500	<Company>	beause it's just so insanely wild what it can do
2024-01-31T14:56:31-0500	<hergertme>	i had the realization that if you build the fundamental list[] there is no reason you can't do most of what we're doing in databases for local apps as things on top 
2024-01-31T14:56:32-0500	<andrewrk>	Ankhers, if you're talking about the zig tarballs, you are mistaken. they do work on nixos
2024-01-31T14:56:33-0500	<hergertme>	indexing, everything 
2024-01-31T14:56:55-0500	<andrewrk>	statically linked binaries work fine on nixos
2024-01-31T14:57:03-0500	<Ankhers>	Oh. I didn't realize it was statically linked.
2024-01-31T14:57:07-0500	<hergertme>	relations, query model, etc fits right on top 
2024-01-31T14:57:12-0500	<Company>	there's a bit of an issue with databases and what apps do with list[], and that's handling uniqueness
2024-01-31T14:57:24-0500	<Company>	is [2, 2] and [2, 2] the same order or different?
2024-01-31T14:57:37-0500	<hergertme>	well yeah i get the whole object liveness thing 
2024-01-31T14:57:42-0500	<andrewrk>	not only that but zig detects the native dynamic linker at runtime so you will be able to link with libc and use the compiler with no issues on nixos
2024-01-31T14:57:49-0500	<Ankhers>	andrewrk: I still prefer to use nix where possible, but I appreciate the fact it is statically linked.
2024-01-31T14:57:56-0500	<hergertme>	but from a modeling standpoint, unique'ness == index + enforcement 
2024-01-31T14:58:15-0500	<Company>	the problem with index is that it breaks with reordering
2024-01-31T14:58:24-0500	<Company>	databases solve that with ids
2024-01-31T14:58:42-0500	<Company>	but list[]s don't
2024-01-31T14:58:43-0500	<hergertme>	well primary keys, but yeah
2024-01-31T14:58:52-0500	<hergertme>	there is no guarantee that you primary key must be an id 
2024-01-31T14:58:59-0500	<ebassi>	https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Foundation-Lottie-Format â heh
2024-01-31T14:59:01-0500	<hergertme>	although internally many still do have an object id inside 
2024-01-31T14:59:56-0500	<hergertme>	ebassi: maybe that makes gtk a candidate for some of that linux foundation sustaining engineering money? :)
2024-01-31T15:00:02-0500	<Company>	ebassi: woah
2024-01-31T15:00:09-0500	<Company>	I thought Lottie was dead
2024-01-31T15:00:21-0500	<Company>	hadn't seen anything happening with it in a while
2024-01-31T15:00:51-0500	<hergertme>	Company: by reordering do you just mean changing sort?
2024-01-31T15:01:45-0500	<hergertme>	beacuse that itself is a dynamic index (plus cursor), a real index, a cursor iteration direction, etc 
2024-01-31T15:01:56-0500	<hergertme>	but it does mean the equivalent of an items-changed(full table) ofc
2024-01-31T15:02:24-0500	<Company>	I'm mostly thinking about the fast that both those numbers occupy different pixels on the screen
2024-01-31T15:02:37-0500	<Company>	and if they get swapped, you want to animate that
2024-01-31T15:02:48-0500	<Company>	and if they don't get swapped, you don't
2024-01-31T15:03:14-0500	<Company>	and for that you need to know if something changed when you went from [2, 2] to [2, 2]
2024-01-31T15:03:17-0500	<hergertme>	you need a comparator for equality, but i dont see that needing to exist anywhere outside the view 
2024-01-31T15:03:49-0500	<Company>	sure, that would be good enough probably
2024-01-31T15:04:09-0500	<Company>	the selection handling would need it, too
2024-01-31T15:04:15-0500	<hergertme>	your view range can still get the whole-table-change but has a reference until the next frame. gets the new values, does merge sort of sets to avoid (visbile-n2^) 
2024-01-31T15:04:40-0500	<hergertme>	is aÂ¹ in b, etc
2024-01-31T15:05:39-0500	<hergertme>	webkitgtk-6 feels extremely good on 140hz now, yay dmabufs

2024-01-31T15:21:17-0500	<hergertme>	we can just decide to make our ui designer after effects 
2024-01-31T15:29:43-0500	<humm>	it annoys me a little that âkernel headersâ and /usr/include/sys are distinct nowadays
2024-01-31T15:29:55-0500	<Company>	I don't think that works
2024-01-31T15:30:01-0500	<Company>	because AE isn't interactive
2024-01-31T15:30:01-0500	<omegatron>	understandable
2024-01-31T15:30:31-0500	<Company>	you specify a bunch of operations that run in order and create the frames of an output image
2024-01-31T15:31:31-0500	<Company>	you might be able to hook interactivity in there, because you can just treat it like any other input
2024-01-31T15:31:59-0500	<Company>	but it makes the UI harder to use, because the UI is all about scrubbing through the timeline

2024-01-31T15:36:54-0500	<Famine>	hrm this is odd, I only have 1 hexchat window open but 2 of me are logged in. I think i found a WSLg bug where the RDP client crashes after 15 hours and doesn't restore the previous state leading to multiple instances
2024-01-31T15:38:12-0500	<Famine>	yep 4 day old hexchat process lol
2024-01-31T15:38:24-0500	<omegatron>	wonderful
2024-01-31T15:42:20-0500	<KillerWasp>	Famine: ? i can have hexchat with 1 week of use and dont show problem.
2024-01-31T15:42:48-0500	<Famine>	KillerWasp, the bug is in WSLg not hexchat
2024-01-31T15:43:35-0500	<KillerWasp>	oh, ok
2024-01-31T15:44:02-0500	<Famine>	i could actually install the windows version of hexchat but i'm lazy
2024-01-31T15:44:25-0500	<omegatron>	reminds of some story someone told me recently, where their company introduced pair programming ... after two days of trying, all computer scientists refused to come back to workplace if this continues, because "they mentally crashed after 15 hours"
2024-01-31T15:47:19-0500	<omegatron>	(to explain the 15 hours: they started at thursday (8 work hours) and continued to friday (7 work hours), so they could report back after thinking about their experience after the weekend)
2024-01-31T15:49:05-0500	<Famine>	"pair programming" just seems like a dumb idea that come from some team building nutjob
2024-01-31T15:50:19-0500	<omegatron>	it's only useful, when you introduce someone to the job or project aka teaching exercise ; otherwise, it's totally crap (at least for me)
2024-01-31T15:51:04-0500	<Jupelius>	Pair programming can be very productive in right circumstances
2024-01-31T15:51:59-0500	<omegatron>	I don't deny, that it can be ok for some people or situations, but I haven't met any of them yet in my life
2024-01-31T15:52:09-0500	<Jupelius>	It's quite exhausting though, I've done it couple times
2024-01-31T15:52:39-0500	<Jupelius>	Colleague led me through some FPGA stuff couple years back and it was good
2024-01-31T15:53:30-0500	<Famine>	Jupelius, As a teaching tool, I can see the value. As a production tool, not so much
2024-01-31T15:53:32-0500	<omegatron>	yeah, well, that's this 'teaching exercise' situation I mentioned .. can be good for people, who don't like to read a manual or documentation first
2024-01-31T15:55:30-0500	<Famine>	omegatron, I could see the value even after reading the manual for some complex tasks, I RTFM on arm CM33 bring up and CRT0 implementation last night but i'm still flipping back and forth double checking things every 10 minutes
2024-01-31T16:48:56-0500	<somercet>	so I see vis now builds %.o files, then links 'em, instead of a unified build.

2024-02-01T13:13:15-0500	<somercet>	Am I correct in thinking that passing a pointer to an array in a function cannot be protected by the const keyword?
2024-02-01T13:15:24-0500	<zcrayfish>	if there's a /dev entry for the partition in question, most likely adding an appropriate entry to /etc/fstab will do the trick.  disclaimer: I have not had a chance to try Apple's aarch64 hardware yet, so I might be completely wrong.
2024-02-01T13:16:34-0500	<tdr>	bepeop-no-robot partition size and fs size arent hard linked, try to grow your fs
2024-02-01T13:18:01-0500	<somercet>	in other words, may I pass search(const gchar *string, const gboolean searchflags[])
2024-02-01T13:19:53-0500	<somercet>	and will searchflags be protected from modification from the invoked func?
2024-02-01T13:22:12-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	Thanks will try after dinner :)
2024-02-01T13:36:46-0500	<omegatron>	"protection" is relative with the ability of type casting
2024-02-01T13:37:44-0500	<omegatron>	just don't do it  =)
2024-02-01T13:41:33-0500	<Neui[m]>	It describes intent (this func doesnt mofify its args) but it can try to cast const away
2024-02-01T13:43:09-0500	<somercet>	right
2024-02-01T13:43:25-0500	<somercet>	and whether it can is implementation-dependent?
2024-02-01T13:44:31-0500	<omegatron>	I have never used a compiler, which would not allow me to cast away a 'const' qualifier
2024-02-01T13:44:43-0500	<somercet>	gotcha
2024-02-01T13:45:04-0500	<somercet>	well, I guess I just send three args by value, ty
2024-02-01T13:45:18-0500	<omegatron>	after all 'const' is only a "soft" requirement and a human is the main audience - but nothing stops you from casting

2024-02-01T15:23:14-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	Sadly I messed up the ext4 partition, so I will start tomorrow from scratch.
2024-02-01T15:23:56-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	Is there any more documentaiton than this blog post: https://arvanta.net/alpine/install-alpine-m1/
2024-02-01T15:26:30-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	and the https://arvanta.net/alpine/alpine-installer.mp4 video and script https://arvanta.net/asahi/aai.sh from the video. 
2024-02-01T15:31:21-0500	<dwfreed>	bepeop-no-robot: the -i flag to df shows *inodes* not filesystem space

2024-02-01T15:32:23-0500	<satmd>	when coworkers want to resize lvms or partitions, I always point them at fsadm
2024-02-01T15:32:42-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	Ok, lemme check if I missread and actually already succeded 
2024-02-01T15:33:38-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	if this actuallly works, I will be very happy and contribute some documentation.
2024-02-01T15:33:55-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	I have been running fedora last week and it is so bloated
2024-02-01T15:42:49-0500	<twkm>	in c you can only pass by value anyway.
2024-02-01T15:45:14-0500	<dwfreed>	that's really irrelevant here
2024-02-01T15:46:07-0500	<twkm>	yet somercet said sie would "just" do that, implying that somehow other than pass by value was considered.
2024-02-01T15:49:19-0500	<dwfreed>	I mean, passing a pointer gets you effectively pass-by-reference even if it's not exactly the same
2024-02-01T15:50:32-0500	<dwfreed>	realistically, references in C++ are just pointers with added magic so you don't have to think of them as such
2024-02-01T16:11:57-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	@dwfreed you where correct. resize2fs solved my problem. Thanks for helping everybody
2024-02-01T16:43:06-0500	<henrix>	Hi! What's the best way to keep an old kernel along with a new version when there's an upgrade?
2024-02-01T16:44:02-0500	<henrix>	Sure I can keep a copy of it (with modules and initramfs), but I was hoping to have an easier way for doing that
2024-02-01T16:49:24-0500	<henrix>	hmm.. maybe kernel-hooks can help
2024-02-01T17:05:58-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	I have installed the mesa-asahi drivers, but even the foot terminal has input lag. should I use different packages than the ones here: https://privatebin.net/?db86c7942384bd38#6vf2d6SqmDJMncCQbLf2XcMjjjg9dS8qZyNhMKrxnxGv
2024-02-01T17:11:11-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	Also how can I install julia or juliaup. I tried install juliaup from rust, but this error occurs.

2024-02-01T17:16:39-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	@mps I can help, just tell me what to write. Based on my experience today I, what is missing is: Resize after first boot and which graphic drivers are missing. 
2024-02-01T17:19:29-0500	<mps>	bepeop-no-robot: graphic drivers don't missing if you install mesa-asahi
2024-02-01T17:21:07-0500	<mps>	main problem is in that resize root FS is too risky, better give the expected size need + 20-30%

2024-02-01T17:25:38-0500	<clandmeter>	nope it isnt 
2024-02-01T17:29:38-0500	<mps>	bepeop-no-robot: if you plan to start again to install it could make video of last steps after first reboot, this could be useful for new users
2024-02-01T17:34:14-0500	<mps>	bepeop-no-robot: about slow foot, latest mesa asahi works though yes, sometimes it is not as on 'normal' mesa
2024-02-01T17:34:32-0500	<mps>	but it works fine all in all
2024-02-01T17:36:34-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	@mps Sure. I can install again and make the video. 
2024-02-01T17:38:43-0500	<mps>	bepeop-no-robot: on what model you install?

2024-02-01T17:49:46-0500	<pony>	a sport of some kind
2024-02-01T17:49:47-0500	<constxqt>	thanks bros
2024-02-01T18:00:58-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	m1 mac mini
2024-02-01T18:01:05-0500	<andrewrk>	ifreund, putting this on your radar for river: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/18778
2024-02-01T18:01:41-0500	<andrewrk>	after this lands, I'd be interested to find out if there is anything else you desire to land in 0.12
2024-02-01T18:02:07-0500	<andrewrk>	particularly in the interest of making it easier to package river in linux distros
2024-02-01T18:02:46-0500	<andrewrk>	also would be interested to know what you consider to be blockers for switching from git submodules to zig build (if you are even interested in that)
2024-02-01T18:05:36-0500	<ifreund>	andrewrk: very cool! I am definitely interested in switching away from submodules but must admit I haven't tried zig's builtin package mananger yet
2024-02-01T18:06:18-0500	<andrewrk>	yeah, understandable. well it's a good time to try I think because my goal right now is basically to make sure everybody who wants to pin to 0.12 is happy and then cut the release
2024-02-01T18:07:18-0500	<ifreund>	Am I right that this will allow distros to ship zig packages using their distro package manager and cause those to be used rather than fetching from the URL in the build.zig.zon?
2024-02-01T18:07:46-0500	<ifreund>	or is this currently just about linking system libraries, not pure-zig dependencies
2024-02-01T18:07:50-0500	<andrewrk>	yes, the mechanism for that is that distros are expected to pass --system [dir] where [dir] is a path that has zig packages provided by the distro
2024-02-01T18:07:56-0500	<ifreund>	perfect
2024-02-01T18:08:10-0500	<andrewrk>	this does 2 things: 1. disables fetching entirely, no network access
2024-02-01T18:08:31-0500	<andrewrk>	2. reverses the default so that all system libs default to enabled, and you have to opt out if you want the zig package instead
2024-02-01T18:08:45-0500	<andrewrk>	that's still TODO in this branch however
2024-02-01T18:08:54-0500	<ifreund>	Yeah, I definitely need to get my projects updated to Zig master and test before 0.12.0 :)
2024-02-01T18:09:13-0500	<ifreund>	Great to see this use-case being taken seriously though :)
2024-02-01T18:09:50-0500	<mps>	ah, J274AP code
2024-02-01T18:10:04-0500	<andrewrk>	I think it's going to be interesting, it's kind of like a negotiation between the distro and the upstream developer. they each have ways to communicate what they want without being overly specific
2024-02-01T18:10:25-0500	<andrewrk>	the upstream author can find out that the person running zig build *wants* to integrate with their system and still ignore that request
2024-02-01T18:10:39-0500	<andrewrk>	and of course the distro maintainer can simply patch the upstream project
2024-02-01T18:11:19-0500	<andrewrk>	so as far as zig build is concerned I just try to make it so that the respective parties can communicate exactly what they want, so that hopefully a solution that satisfies everybody's needs is possible to encode
2024-02-01T18:11:22-0500	<mps>	it should work fine with alpine
2024-02-01T18:11:29-0500	<ifreund>	Yeah, distro maintainers will probably still complain some about Zig due to not all projects making the effort to integrate with the system
2024-02-01T18:11:31-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	What a lucky day, building julia from scratch worked just fine. Maybe I can ever contribute my first APKBUILD
2024-02-01T18:11:57-0500	<ifreund>	that's why they like meson, the default is proper integration with the system
2024-02-01T18:12:00-0500	<andrewrk>	ah right, but, the patches being sent to upstream maintainers should hopefully look reasonable and attractive to merge
2024-02-01T18:12:27-0500	<andrewrk>	and it gives them the ability to, e.g. notice that it's a system integrated library and change their bug report link ;)
2024-02-01T18:12:40-0500	<ifreund>	very true, making this possible in the first place will go a long way, after that it's just reducing friction as much as possible
2024-02-01T18:12:46-0500	<DerTeufel>	This system is certainly better than weird special casing with long if chains
2024-02-01T18:13:59-0500	<andrewrk>	it's definitely a compromise. but I think the non-system-integration capabilities are also crucial 
2024-02-01T18:15:06-0500	<mps>	good night now
2024-02-01T18:15:56-0500	<ifreund>	Yeah I 100% agree on the developer experience being better. I'm looking forward to it being easy to support both use-cases at once in the same build.zig easily
2024-02-01T18:16:23-0500	<ifreund>	it would be nice to statically link wlroots by default for example, it's a much better developer experience 
2024-02-01T18:16:33-0500	<ifreund>	and I could have fully static waylock builds which would be cool
2024-02-01T18:17:36-0500	<ifreund>	Anyhow, off to bed now. Gotta get ahead on sleep before FOSDEM this weekend :)
2024-02-01T18:19:09-0500	<bepeop-no-robot>	good night and thanks for all the great work and support <3
2024-02-01T18:20:06-0500	<somercet>	When should I call g_settings_bind() in my GObject? During init?
2024-02-01T18:32:11-0500	<Company>	mclasen: I had an API idea that might be worth thinking about
2024-02-01T18:32:41-0500	<Company>	instead of encoding capabilities of dmabuf formats inside the dmabuf formats, have multiple properties for different kinds of dmabuf formats
2024-02-01T18:32:59-0500	<Company>	GdkSurface::dmabuf-scanout-formats, GdkSurface::dmabuf-render-formats, ...
2024-02-01T18:43:55-0500	<Company>	I also realized that rounding PangoLayout to the pixel grid doesn't just mean rounding glyphs to multiples of 1024 / scale_factor
2024-02-01T18:44:03-0500	<Company>	it also means getting the initial offset right
2024-02-01T18:44:45-0500	<Company>	which is the same issue Sophie is running into in https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6381
2024-02-01T18:48:49-0500	<andrewrk>	have a great time!
2024-02-01T18:52:01-0500	<bubuche87>	(what is fosdem?)

2024-02-01T19:08:44-0500	<somercet>	ugh
2024-02-01T19:09:43-0500	<poprocks>	somercet: it's not a hard and fast rule, but it seems like the most logical time to run it in most instances. Most demo apps and code samples do that.
2024-02-01T19:11:32-0500	<somercet>	poprocks, ty. Also, before I go on with this, how practical is it to use a Property instead of an object's instance variable? I'm using it to format incoming messages.
2024-02-01T19:12:31-0500	<somercet>	I'm beginning to think I need to set up a subsystem that tracks all the settings, and then dispatches the appropriate calls.
2024-02-01T19:12:45-0500	*	Jan- is now known as Jan
2024-02-01T19:13:00-0500	<somercet>	I get the feeling a property is more internal to GObject than that.
2024-02-01T19:13:59-0500	<somercet>	well, I have GSettings now, and can store search state.
2024-02-01T19:18:34-0500	<nightfrog>	abby: you can modify the ui in perl and lua. More of us have done it in perl. 
2024-02-01T19:18:42-0500	<somercet>	Xtext just accesses prefs directly. I think I will set up a subsystem to dispatch proper functions and signals.
2024-02-01T19:19:16-0500	<poprocks>	I can tell you countless times I've thought "aw jeez, I should have used a GObject property rather than a raw instance variable." I can't really think of a single time I've thought "ah,I wish I *hadn't* used a gobject property for that variable"
2024-02-01T19:20:02-0500	<somercet>	huh
2024-02-01T19:20:31-0500	<nightfrog>	It's not 100% though
2024-02-01T19:21:28-0500	<poprocks>	maybe that's a bit extreme. But if it's something library-user-facing, it's probably better to make it a property than not. Because then you get the benefit of looking at it in the inspector, using bindings, using GtkExpression, etc
2024-02-01T19:23:32-0500	<nightfrog>	I've done it in perl and c++/assembly plugins. Knowing gtk in c and the other language helps. It 
2024-02-01T19:28:21-0500	<somercet>	I set a default value for a string property but it did not get set when I called g_object_get(). in init. Dunno why, still working on it.
2024-02-01T19:30:18-0500	<poprocks>	not sure without seeing more context, but it could be a function of not setting G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT
2024-02-01T19:31:36-0500	<somercet>	ah
2024-02-01T19:31:56-0500	<somercet>	no, I did not.

2024-02-01T19:32:42-0500	<poprocks>	well, don't thank me until you've tried it and it works :)  but it's a possibility :)
2024-02-01T19:33:38-0500	<somercet>	oh, yeah,  I know.

2024-02-01T19:34:07-0500	<martin2020>	hi, is there something similar to static functions but for struct?
2024-02-01T19:34:40-0500	<martin2020>	I would like to avoid name collisions for structs that I will only use in my .c file
2024-02-01T19:34:50-0500	<martin2020>	Is there a way to do this in c?
2024-02-01T19:35:58-0500	<somercet>	For a struct definition? Don't think so. Declaring an instance? yes, static.
2024-02-01T19:36:45-0500	<martin2020>	Okay, thanks. So I just have to have unique names for all my struct definitions?
2024-02-01T19:37:08-0500	<somercet>	I've been at this all day. Time to sleep and start again tomorrow. Thanks for the help.
2024-02-01T19:37:19-0500	<poprocks>	cheers.
2024-02-01T19:38:44-0500	<gog>	yeah a type is visible to all the scopes where it's defined
2024-02-01T19:38:44-0500	<somercet>	a variable can be linked. I don't think a definition can be. So I'm not sure unique names matter, as long as the coder knows which is which.
2024-02-01T19:39:17-0500	<gog>	so if you have a struct that you only use in one .c file, if you define it there it won't be visible to any other .c file
2024-02-01T19:39:58-0500	<gog>	but if you define another struct with the same name in a header and include that header, or a chain of headers that eventually include it, you'll get an error
2024-02-01T19:41:06-0500	<martin2020>	gog, somercet, thanks. that is cool. So maybe I am misunderstanding the point of static functions. defining static functions in a .c file is pointless, since the .c file won't be included anywhere? Like, static functions only are meaningfully different from other functions in .h files?
2024-02-01T19:41:36-0500	<somercet>	other way around
2024-02-01T19:42:03-0500	<martin2020>	Yea, having static function couldn't be defined in .h file, so...
2024-02-01T19:42:08-0500	<gog>	a static function is a little different and that gets into the subtleties of how objects are linked
2024-02-01T19:42:14-0500	<somercet>	a variable is a bit of RAM, plus a pointer to it. A function is a bit of code with a pointer to it.

2024-02-02T09:27:54-0500	<somercet>	tintou, are you saying I should not check for invalid properties in derived classes?
2024-02-02T09:28:07-0500	<kurahaupo>	stanrifkin: C is an open standard. Some implementations are open source (clang, gcc), some are not (msvc, intel-cc).
2024-02-02T09:28:17-0500	<NRK>	but then again, most search engines currently are trashed with SEO garbage anyways.
2024-02-02T09:28:33-0500	<stanrifkin>	kurahaupo: thank you :)
2024-02-02T09:30:38-0500	<tintou>	Well, just apply the same thing as the link I gave you, so yes it should be a warning at the end of the switch block
2024-02-02T09:33:13-0500	<humm>	pragma-, kurahaupo: little reminder that conforming programs may use extensions
2024-02-02T09:34:04-0500	<pragma->	the ... range operator is a bit more than a mere extension, as are many other gnuisms
2024-02-02T09:36:52-0500	<somercet>	GParamSpec *obj_properties[N_PROPERTIES] is not defined in file scope, not in _class_init, is that optional? or mandatory?
2024-02-02T09:36:57-0500	<humm>	as long as the implementation is conforming; i.e., as long as it accepts all strictly conforming programs / doesnât have extensions contradicting the standard; all programs accepted by that implementation are conforming
2024-02-02T09:37:22-0500	<humm>	which makes âconforming programâ a rather useless label
2024-02-02T09:37:45-0500	<solol>	Hm.
2024-02-02T09:40:47-0500	<solol>	What are you guys trying to get at?

2024-02-02T09:41:53-0500	<solol>	What are you into humm?
2024-02-02T09:42:01-0500	<kurahaupo>	humm: logically a conforming program is one that is acceptable to all possible conforming implementations, not just any one conforming implementation

2024-02-02T09:46:33-0500	<leeward>	If I have something like `const Thing = struct { array: [10]bool };` is there an easy way to get the length of Thing.array from just the type?
2024-02-02T09:47:04-0500	<leeward>	Do I need to use @typeInfo for this, or is there something obvious that I'm missing?
2024-02-02T09:49:19-0500	<Company>	mclasen: tranches in the GdkDmabufFormats, yeah
2024-02-02T09:49:41-0500	<Company>	mclasen: and a simpler DmabufFormats is easier to keep immutable, too
2024-02-02T09:50:16-0500	<Company>	otoh it pollutes the GdkSurface namespace
2024-02-02T09:51:10-0500	<Company>	and people need to thing about which of the properties they want and find them by themselves, because a GdkDmabufFormats doesn't tell you what to care about
2024-02-02T09:54:16-0500	<pekster>	POSIX makes the distinction of a "strictly conforming" program (one that uses _nothing_ outside what POSIX gives you) vs. a "conforming" application, which may use extensions but requires they be documented.
2024-02-02T09:54:53-0500	<jacobly0>	`@typeInfo(std.meta.FieldType(Thing, .array)).Array.len`
2024-02-02T09:55:05-0500	<pekster>	That concept can apply to C, although strictly ISO-C tends to be rather limiting in practice, far more than POSIX (which itself requires all you get with ISO-C plus all the SUS features.)
2024-02-02T09:55:30-0500	<leeward>	Thanks jacobly0, I thought it might come to that.

2024-02-02T09:58:10-0500	<SomeRandoUser>	Is there a way to have gcc preprocess a file, but only process includes, and leave all of the macro definitions intact?
2024-02-02T10:06:41-0500	<humm>	kurahaupo, thatâs a strictly conforming program, and very limiting, in that there are a bunch of things that have quite small limitsâidentifier length, type width, and stuff like that
2024-02-02T10:08:02-0500	<humm>	solol: Iâm into sugar
2024-02-02T10:08:50-0500	<humm>	pekster, the C standard makes a similar distinction
2024-02-02T10:10:20-0500	<humm>	SomeRandoUser: that wouldnât work, as #include directives can depend on macros
2024-02-02T10:11:05-0500	<SomeRandoUser>	hmm true.
2024-02-02T10:11:20-0500	<SomeRandoUser>	what I'm basically want is...
2024-02-02T10:11:47-0500	<SomeRandoUser>	my C file has a bunch of includes at the top, and I want to combine all of them into a single file.
2024-02-02T10:12:00-0500	<SomeRandoUser>	that can be included and have the same effect
2024-02-02T10:12:27-0500	<humm>	write a source file containing the #include directives

2024-02-02T10:25:05-0500	<mclasen>	feaneron: its busy today. Half of gnome is crashing on our couch
2024-02-02T10:25:26-0500	<alatiera>	what if we made the load_from_file methods in Image/Picture handle the loading of the texture in thread on their own and by default
2024-02-02T10:25:48-0500	<alatiera>	cause atm it's all done blocking on the main thread and everyone has to diy the async loading
2024-02-02T10:25:52-0500	<feaneron>	cool, hopefully accompanied by nice beverages :)
2024-02-02T10:26:53-0500	<Company>	alatiera: you want the loading to be sync, because otherwise your app starts up glitching
2024-02-02T10:26:57-0500	<mclasen>	there's beer and coffee
2024-02-02T10:27:23-0500	<Company>	alatiera: and if you want to load external resources, you don't want to use GTK's load_from_file() but an actually secure method
2024-02-02T10:27:40-0500	<alatiera>	then we should kill gtk's mehtods
2024-02-02T10:27:47-0500	<alatiera>	casue those are the ones everyone is using
2024-02-02T10:27:54-0500	<alatiera>	and stumble upon
2024-02-02T10:28:12-0500	<Company>	we need those for icons
2024-02-02T10:28:28-0500	<Company>	and css resources
2024-02-02T10:29:00-0500	<alatiera>	if they are there people will them outside of that, so we could either make them nice or nuke em I guess
2024-02-02T10:29:02-0500	<mclasen>	The wouldn't have to be public fo rthat
2024-02-02T10:29:14-0500	<mclasen>	but I don't think we want to make them private
2024-02-02T10:29:36-0500	<mclasen>	aren't they nice enough ?
2024-02-02T10:29:38-0500	<Company>	there's lots of places where you want to load safe resources
2024-02-02T10:29:56-0500	<Company>	the problem is that we can't know if something is safe or not
2024-02-02T10:30:33-0500	<Company>	one thing I've always wanted is restrict GTK to PNG and JPEG
2024-02-02T10:30:50-0500	<Company>	so people who need anything else, like webp, need to use a different loader
2024-02-02T10:31:07-0500	<alatiera>	mclasen: they block the main thread people get very confused why the window stops responding
2024-02-02T10:31:11-0500	<Company>	but that's the only idea I've had so far
2024-02-02T10:31:39-0500	<bananicorn>	Hi, I just tried to use iwd on a pretty empty alpine linux install and it complains about a ton of missing ciphers and cryptographic functions
2024-02-02T10:31:47-0500	<bananicorn>	Could there be a missing dependency here?
2024-02-02T10:32:01-0500	<Company>	the ultimate problem is that Gnome sucks
2024-02-02T10:32:03-0500	<alatiera>	I had someone ask me just today: "I made a grid view from a model with gfileinfo and the whole thing block until all the images are loaded, what's going on"
2024-02-02T10:32:08-0500	<Company>	and doesn't have an image loading library
2024-02-02T10:32:12-0500	<Company>	because nobody gives a shit
2024-02-02T10:32:37-0500	<zcrayfish>	can you pastebin the errors you are getting, e.g. using https://tpaste.us/ ?
2024-02-02T10:32:40-0500	<mclasen>	there's glycin now
2024-02-02T10:33:01-0500	<Company>	yes, but that's not a gnome image loading library - at least not yet
2024-02-02T10:33:06-0500	<mclasen>	I don't think an explicit new_from_file_async() would be bad
2024-02-02T10:33:14-0500	<bananicorn>	will do!
2024-02-02T10:33:37-0500	<Company>	I think it would be bad
2024-02-02T10:33:53-0500	<alatiera>	I thought about _async but would rather change the default behavior if possible tbh
2024-02-02T10:34:07-0500	<alatiera>	but wouldn't mind _async though
2024-02-02T10:34:13-0500	<Company>	I would very much
2024-02-02T10:34:21-0500	<Company>	because I don't want to fix CVEs
2024-02-02T10:34:39-0500	<Company>	or get into discussions about webp and jxl and whatnot support
2024-02-02T10:34:56-0500	<alatiera>	is it any different than the current methods?
2024-02-02T10:35:07-0500	<Company>	yes
2024-02-02T10:35:27-0500	<Company>	the current methods are not secure
2024-02-02T10:35:38-0500	<Company>	and not meant to be
2024-02-02T10:36:14-0500	<Company>	also: you immediately get the question about how to do progress notifications
2024-02-02T10:36:17-0500	<bananicorn>	https://paste.debian.net/hidden/692339ae
2024-02-02T10:36:41-0500	<Company>	which is also something that depends on use case
2024-02-02T10:37:07-0500	<Company>	don't get me wrong, I'm totally not saying that there shouldn't be an easy async loading method
2024-02-02T10:37:11-0500	<alatiera>	the current behavior avoids that by: blocking the main thread
2024-02-02T10:37:15-0500	<mclasen>	alatiera: You can change the new_from_file to do threading, but you can't make it async
2024-02-02T10:37:44-0500	<Company>	alatiera: yes, it tells you "don't do that"
2024-02-02T10:37:46-0500	<mclasen>	Company: not sure what the relation between async and cves
2024-02-02T10:37:49-0500	<bananicorn>	perhaps a missing kernel module?
2024-02-02T10:38:04-0500	<Company>	mclasen: the relationship is that async is only needed for insecure stuff
2024-02-02T10:38:08-0500	<alatiera>	mclasen: mmm, I think that would be enough actually
2024-02-02T10:38:17-0500	<alatiera>	and it's basically what all the apps are doing
2024-02-02T10:38:17-0500	<mclasen>	async is needed for big stuff
2024-02-02T10:38:27-0500	<Company>	mclasen: secure stuff is stored in a resource or in /usr/share and can be loaded sync
2024-02-02T10:38:53-0500	<alatiera>	although, I guess it would still be blocking as it would be returning the widget rather than a task
2024-02-02T10:39:12-0500	<Company>	for widgets, you also have to fix the sizing issue
2024-02-02T10:39:17-0500	<Company>	at least for GtkPicture
2024-02-02T10:39:29-0500	<Company>	because until you've read the image header, you don't know the size
2024-02-02T10:39:45-0500	<Company>	and then you need to decide if you want to separate the header loading from the decoding
2024-02-02T10:39:51-0500	<mclasen>	you could do progressive loading, but that sounds like gdk-pixbuf reborn
2024-02-02T10:39:55-0500	<Company>	which would allow you to size quickly
2024-02-02T10:40:00-0500	<mclasen>	GdkPixbufLoader, to be precise
2024-02-02T10:40:03-0500	<Company>	yes
2024-02-02T10:40:24-0500	<Company>	you could put all of that into a GlycinPaintable
2024-02-02T10:40:37-0500	<Company>	but https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/introduction/overview/libraries.html says you should use gdk-pixbuf
2024-02-02T10:41:22-0500	<Company>	you can make very nice APIs, even implementing GtkSymbolicPaintable and stuff
2024-02-02T10:41:46-0500	<Company>	to do progressive loading, early header parsing, off-thread everything, and so on
2024-02-02T10:42:00-0500	<Company>	but you want to do that in an image loading library, not in GTK proper
2024-02-02T10:43:37-0500	<Company>	you can even do stuff like decode thumbnails first, because large JPEGs can contain thumbnails
2024-02-02T10:43:43-0500	<ikke>	What kernel are you running?
2024-02-02T10:43:46-0500	<Company>	and all that jazz
2024-02-02T10:44:00-0500	<Company>	and GdkPaintable is a great interface for that
2024-02-02T10:44:18-0500	<Company>	and you can even do that with UI files if you want to load real fancy stuff in UI files
2024-02-02T10:44:42-0500	<Company>	<property name="paintable"><GObject class="GlycinFancyLoaderPaintable">...
2024-02-02T10:44:55-0500	<Company>	the infrastructure is all there, just the code is missing
2024-02-02T10:46:52-0500	<Company>	you could also implement a custom Widget that does all the displaying, because afaik GtkPicture does not need any private APIs - but it's probably easier to do a composite widget that contains a GtkPicture
2024-02-02T10:47:44-0500	<Company>	also, Loupe probably has all the code already, because Loupe is good at that stuff
2024-02-02T10:48:08-0500	<Company>	it's just that nobody turned it into a library and promoted it into the Gnome platform
2024-02-02T10:53:11-0500	<Company>	mclasen: about the clipping subsurface stuff - do we have a way to test that? Like, is there some files that our demo video player can play, that expose the problem?
2024-02-02T10:53:22-0500	<Company>	or some app that rmader hacks on that does?
2024-02-02T10:53:41-0500	<mclasen>	we don't have the gstreamer support for this yet
2024-02-02T10:53:42-0500	<Company>	or is that just 3 weird embedded platforms that have that problem?
2024-02-02T10:53:51-0500	<mclasen>	rmader said: "after fosdem"
2024-02-02T10:54:11-0500	<mclasen>	we have tests for the offloading infrastructure by itself
2024-02-02T10:54:12-0500	<Company>	I was wondering about waiting with the MR until we do and then deciding what we actually need
2024-02-02T10:54:34-0500	<mclasen>	ie I can test that putting a clipnode around your texture node sets the expected source rect on the subusurface
2024-02-02T10:54:57-0500	<Company>	yeah, but does that need to handle putting a transform node inbetween?
2024-02-02T10:55:07-0500	<Company>	and is clip-in-clip a thing?
2024-02-02T10:55:18-0500	<Company>	with transform nodes inbetween?
2024-02-02T10:55:27-0500	<Company>	stuff like that
2024-02-02T10:56:12-0500	<Company>	did I mention I looked at libmpv yesterday because somebody was talking about celluloid?
2024-02-02T10:56:18-0500	<mclasen>	no
2024-02-02T10:56:39-0500	<mclasen>	people can put whatever they want between the offload widget and the picture
2024-02-02T10:57:08-0500	<mclasen>	so, in theory stuff can appear between the subsurface node and the clip node
2024-02-02T10:57:11-0500	<Company>	I wanted to see how celluloid embeds mpv because redditors had the weirdest ideas how to get hardware decoding working
2024-02-02T10:57:27-0500	<mclasen>	but the clip node and the texture node are both generated by the gstpaintable
2024-02-02T10:57:38-0500	<mclasen>	so I don't know why anything would come between the two
2024-02-02T10:58:04-0500	<Company>	it turns out celluloid has a dmabuf video-out framework, so it'd be rather trivial to write a dmabuf output that gives you a GdkPaintable I'd think
2024-02-02T10:58:59-0500	<Company>	I was thinking that the GstPaintable might want to generate more things - and sometimes the math is easier when you put the clip on the outside
2024-02-02T10:59:14-0500	<Company>	also, GtkSnapshot can randomly insert transform nodes sometimes
2024-02-02T10:59:27-0500	<mclasen>	hergertme: the ebassi/accessible-text branch should be functional enough now to look at implementing this interface in vte
2024-02-02T10:59:41-0500	<mps>	missing drivers in kernel
2024-02-02T11:01:26-0500	<mclasen>	I absolutely think that the math is easiest when the clip node wraps right around the texture node
2024-02-02T11:02:19-0500	<Company>	I absolutely think the math is easiest if you can do it however
2024-02-02T11:02:29-0500	<mclasen>	what math anyway ?
2024-02-02T11:03:42-0500	<Company>	the math that gets the coordinates right to get the texture clipped right and the result put on screen
2024-02-02T11:03:54-0500	<mclasen>	putting the clip outside the subsurface node isn't something I want to support, regardless
2024-02-02T11:04:12-0500	<mclasen>	even if I were to turn that loop into a recursion
2024-02-02T11:04:35-0500	<telmich>	For some time I seem to have a bug in tmux that when I attach, some weird characters are being sent to it
2024-02-02T11:04:51-0500	<telmich>	One example is 00/0000eee/d1d1
2024-02-02T11:04:59-0500	<telmich>	Has anyone else seen that?
2024-02-02T11:05:08-0500	<mclasen>	whats the difference anyway? we only support a linear branch there, so using a loop to walk it seems just fine
2024-02-02T11:05:14-0500	<Company>	yeah, that's probably not the most relevant - though it could be interesting if people want to allow zooming in or something
2024-02-02T11:05:30-0500	<zcrayfish>	which terminal emultor and which TERM environmental variable do you have set before attaching?
2024-02-02T11:05:39-0500	<zcrayfish>	s/emultor/emulator 
2024-02-02T11:06:15-0500	<Company>	but that's a question for apps that yalter writes, and those usually don't want to offload anyway because they want to use NEAREST scaling and display multiple images and whatnot
2024-02-02T11:06:33-0500	<telmich>	I'm on urxvt, TERM=rxvt
2024-02-02T11:06:56-0500	<Company>	anyway, my main interest is in supporting subsurface { transform { clip { clip { transform { texture { }}}}}} style setups
2024-02-02T11:06:59-0500	<telmich>	interesting, that seems to be reset via ssh
2024-02-02T11:07:11-0500	<telmich>	So originally, locally I have: rxvt-unicode-256color
2024-02-02T11:07:24-0500	<Company>	because reshuffling those orders - and using multiple clips - is something that can easily see happening
2024-02-02T11:07:32-0500	<telmich>	Then I login to a server and I have only rxvt left
2024-02-02T11:07:57-0500	<Company>	like when the paintable clips and for some reason GtkPicture (or an alternative widget) adds a clip, too
2024-02-02T11:08:14-0500	<mclasen>	somebody should write that code then
2024-02-02T11:10:46-0500	<Company>	another fun thing: I improved my 1px line demo from yesterday
2024-02-02T11:10:53-0500	<invoked>	not seeing that, and i do everything in tmux local and remote, but i use foot (waynesworld). 
2024-02-02T11:10:56-0500	<Company>	for the fractional scale alignment stuff
2024-02-02T11:10:59-0500	<Company>	and oh boy
2024-02-02T11:11:15-0500	<Company>	I'm not even sure anymore who's doing bad things
2024-02-02T11:12:00-0500	<Company>	I got things rendered correctly - which means GTK, mutter and mutter's screenshot tool can do the right thing
2024-02-02T11:12:27-0500	<Company>	but I also easily get it to screw up - which means at leat one of them is doing the wrong thing sometimes
2024-02-02T11:12:46-0500	<Company>	I'd like to record video, but video isn't lossless, so my pixels instantly get smushed together
2024-02-02T11:14:24-0500	<telmich>	I did have something like that some decades ago
2024-02-02T11:14:43-0500	<telmich>	That I needed to reduce the length of the terminal, but that was a long long long ago hack
2024-02-02T11:14:53-0500	<Company>	the most evil thing is to make the window size odd
2024-02-02T11:15:06-0500	<Company>	250% scale, 99px wide window
2024-02-02T11:15:35-0500	<Company>	now you need a 247.5px buffer
2024-02-02T11:15:48-0500	<Company>	I don't actually know what we allocate (didn't check yet)
2024-02-02T11:15:59-0500	<Company>	but things get very wrong
2024-02-02T11:18:19-0500	<mclasen>	is it worth filing an issue about this?
2024-02-02T11:18:53-0500	<Company>	I don't even know who's at fault
2024-02-02T11:19:09-0500	<APic>	Re
2024-02-02T11:19:54-0500	<telmich>	kill me

2024-02-02T11:20:50-0500	<invoked>	oops
2024-02-02T11:21:01-0500	<telmich>	Interesting, the problem persists though with TERM=rxvt-unicode-256color
2024-02-02T11:22:05-0500	<invoked>	are you setting default-terminal in tmux.conf, and if so, to what value?
2024-02-02T11:22:36-0500	<telmich>	I did not modify tmux.conf anywhere so far
2024-02-02T11:23:21-0500	<invoked>	what does $TERM say inside tmux?
2024-02-02T11:23:31-0500	<invoked>	i actually don't know what it defaults to.
2024-02-02T11:23:36-0500	<telmich>	tmux-256color
2024-02-02T11:23:41-0500	<bananicorn>	mps: ikke: All I needed was a reboot, I figured that it failed to load the modules because I performed an apk upgrade to a newer kernel version before starting iwd :)
2024-02-02T11:23:45-0500	<invoked>	okay, so, not that then
2024-02-02T11:23:52-0500	<Company>	mclasen: what's interesting btw is that the glyphs in the 2nd image are all off by 1/2px - that seems like it's doing hinting but aligns everything not to pixel boundaries, but off by 1/2px
2024-02-02T11:23:59-0500	<telmich>	the problem is it happens every time I attach, but only once for each attach
2024-02-02T11:24:16-0500	<telmich>	And it also happens when I spawn a new session
2024-02-02T11:24:17-0500	<Company>	this is all completely invisible to me btw, because the resolution of my monitor is so good
2024-02-02T11:24:24-0500	<Company>	I need to take screenshots and zoom in
2024-02-02T11:24:27-0500	<invoked>	oh now that's interesting.
2024-02-02T11:24:30-0500	<telmich>	And I just realise it happens locally as well as remote
2024-02-02T11:24:31-0500	<invoked>	so that rules out ssh
2024-02-02T11:24:40-0500	<Company>	the first image looks identical to the 2nd, they're both solid gray to me
2024-02-02T11:24:53-0500	<telmich>	locally I just got the following pasted: 10;rgb:0000/0000/0000]11;rgb:eeee/eeee/d1d1
2024-02-02T11:25:01-0500	<Company>	context: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6381#note_1995160
2024-02-02T11:25:55-0500	<invoked>	are you sourcing anything scripts or anything for your prompt
2024-02-02T11:26:23-0500	<invoked>	my hunch is it's your env not tmux
2024-02-02T11:26:40-0500	<telmich>	I do have the following on most machines for setting PS1: PS1='[\t] [\033[1m]\h.ge.nau.so[\033[0m]:\w$ '
2024-02-02T11:26:48-0500	<telmich>	I can remove that for testing
2024-02-02T11:26:55-0500	<invoked>	no that's fine
2024-02-02T11:27:34-0500	<telmich>	Using export PS1="stupidps1%% " does not fix it
2024-02-02T11:28:27-0500	<telmich>	And it hapens on "all hosts" (I've to find a non-alpine linux host for testing)
2024-02-02T11:28:52-0500	<telmich>	ok, it does not happen on Debian
2024-02-02T11:29:41-0500	<invoked>	tmux defaults on debian may not be upstream
2024-02-02T11:30:03-0500	<invoked>	i set some stuff in tmux.conf but i didn't keep notes on specifically why.
2024-02-02T11:30:39-0500	<invoked>	set -g default-terminal 'tmux-256color'
2024-02-02T11:30:41-0500	<invoked>	set -sa terminal-overrides ',tmux-256color:RGB'
2024-02-02T11:30:43-0500	<invoked>	set -ga terminal-overrides ',t

2024-02-02T11:32:48-0500	<invoked>	should be ',tmux-256color:Tc'
2024-02-02T11:33:10-0500	<telmich>	hmm, those three don't change anything for me
2024-02-02T11:33:27-0500	<Company>	mclasen: I think wewant a round-glyph-positions flag for GskTextNode
2024-02-02T11:33:48-0500	<Company>	mclasen: so that it does correct the 0.5px offset for you
2024-02-02T11:33:57-0500	<Company>	in the renderer
2024-02-02T11:34:03-0500	*	PowaBanga_ is now known as PowaBanga
2024-02-02T11:34:05-0500	<Company>	and Pango doesn't have to handle that
2024-02-02T11:34:35-0500	<invoked>	they're probably default anyhow.
2024-02-02T11:35:17-0500	<invoked>	i do this in many of my configs, explicitly set things so that i know when the behavior changes, rather than relying on defaults
2024-02-02T11:35:42-0500	<mclasen>	what if the 0.5 offset is correct?
2024-02-02T11:36:16-0500	<mclasen>	and if we don't do rounding in layout, we work with wrong extents
2024-02-02T11:36:31-0500	<mclasen>	well, 'wrong'
2024-02-02T11:42:38-0500	<Company>	then you don't set the flag
2024-02-02T11:43:06-0500	<Company>	like, I expect it to only be used when Pango also rounds
2024-02-02T11:44:03-0500	<Company>	and if pango rounds everything properly, but gets it wrong by half a pixel (because of the pixel alignment), then all glyphs will be offset by half a pixel
2024-02-02T11:44:26-0500	<Company>	and it'll be the same offset for all glyphs even with multiple rows of text
2024-02-02T11:45:15-0500	<Company>	and it saves you from having to redo the layout every time the widget gets moved by 1px (in user units)
2024-02-02T11:46:23-0500	<Company>	there are things that can go wrong though - like smooth scrolling might look glitchy if it's slow enough to notice the 0.5px adjustment every other frame
2024-02-02T11:46:42-0500	<Company>	or rather: on half the frame, isn't necessarily every other one
2024-02-02T12:05:21-0500	<lakitu>	hey
2024-02-02T12:06:34-0500	<lakitu>	- a free feature idea I thought here was to have bookmarked rooms in a special list in the "channel switcher"
2024-02-02T12:06:54-0500	<lakitu>	then I can see what has activity at a glance (versus scrolling around thru the channel switcher)
2024-02-02T12:10:54-0500	<feaneron>	Company: mind a pm?
2024-02-02T12:12:35-0500	<sney>	hexchat is not actively developed, but maybe you could write a script or plugin to do that 
2024-02-02T12:12:46-0500	<Company>	feaneron: go ahead
2024-02-02T12:15:26-0500	<lakitu>	thanks
2024-02-02T12:15:46-0500	<lakitu>	is there a fork that is developed?
2024-02-02T12:15:54-0500	<lakitu>	`BitchX` for example?
2024-02-02T12:16:16-0500	<sney>	bitchx is older than hexchat and not related to it at all 
2024-02-02T12:16:55-0500	<sney>	there are no actively developed hexchat/xchat forks because large parts of it would need to be rewritten to replace the main gui library
2024-02-02T12:17:09-0500	<lakitu>	mm
2024-02-02T12:17:19-0500	<lakitu>	was there a gui change upstream?
2024-02-02T12:17:19-0500	<sney>	if you're looking for any qualifying irc client, maybe weechat?
2024-02-02T12:17:35-0500	<lakitu>	or?
2024-02-02T12:18:29-0500	<somercet>	lakitu, yes, GTK2 became GTK3, and hexchat is still stuck in GTK2.
2024-02-02T12:18:31-0500	<sney>	x-chat was written for gtk2 in a way that's not trivial to port to a newer graphics toolkit 
2024-02-02T12:19:02-0500	*	You've invited sney to #watertanks (iridium.libera.chat)

2024-02-02T12:19:42-0500	<somercet>	I thought about inviting you and pj and maybe janc to keep you (quietly) updated on progress.
2024-02-02T12:19:58-0500	<sney>	cool, I'm available to test whenever there is something to test 
2024-02-02T12:20:20-0500	<somercet>	If I go tits up on this, I'd rather not do it in front of ~300 people...

2024-02-02T12:20:49-0500	<sney>	sensible
2024-02-02T12:21:01-0500	<lakitu>	well I used `HexChat` for quite a few years. thanks for Good Run ð
2024-02-02T12:21:24-0500	<somercet>	I got GSettings going, and hooked the datetime format into GSettings as a GObject property
2024-02-02T12:21:31-0500	<somercet>	and what a pain that was.
2024-02-02T12:22:31-0500	<somercet>	basically, this is all glib2 functionality, because that stays the same between gtk 2/3
2024-02-02T12:23:42-0500	<seninha>	Hi. If I have `long *p;` and `long (*pairs)[2];`, is `pairs = (void *)p;` portable? Can I then acess `p[5]` with `pairs[2][1]`?
2024-02-02T12:25:17-0500	<sney>	it's pretty popular still, an active fork could pop up at some point before gtk2 is completely gone, but it remains to be seen 
2024-02-02T12:25:19-0500	<somercet>	I also got enough of the searchbar functionality working enough to know my thought of using it to send the searchflags was nonsense.
2024-02-02T12:25:44-0500	<somercet>	so I'll just send three extra arguments. ;-P
2024-02-02T12:30:29-0500	<boukenshaou>	Hi friends
2024-02-02T12:30:31-0500	<lakitu>	sney: well, wish you well. I'll check back on a HexChat fork. see you!
2024-02-02T12:30:39-0500	<boukenshaou>	I have a problem
2024-02-02T12:31:00-0500	<boukenshaou>	I have forgotten the email address I had used to register the nick
2024-02-02T12:31:09-0500	<boukenshaou>	How to know which one it was
2024-02-02T12:32:04-0500	<sney>	boukenshaou: it should appear in /ns info 
2024-02-02T12:32:24-0500	<lakitu>	ð
2024-02-02T12:32:25-0500	<sney>	boukenshaou: also hexchat is just a client application, for registration support you should ask in #libera 
2024-02-02T12:34:18-0500	<boukenshaou>	Thanks

2024-02-02T12:39:50-0500	<boukenshaou>	Now I have question specific to hexchat client
2024-02-02T12:40:39-0500	<boukenshaou>	I don't want to see prompts about users quitting in my message box
2024-02-02T12:40:44-0500	<boukenshaou>	very distracting
2024-02-02T12:40:50-0500	<boukenshaou>	How to switch it off?
2024-02-02T12:40:51-0500	<nitrix>	seninha, In theory no, in practice yes.
2024-02-02T12:41:23-0500	<sney>	per channel you can right click the channel name in the switcher, under settings "hide join/part messages" 
2024-02-02T12:42:00-0500	<sney>	there's also a global setting under chatting->general, or the smartparts script that only shows it for active users

2024-02-02T12:43:54-0500	<rendar>	https://bpa.st/SPY3O -- is this normal? please note line 7 where i dind't spell default correctly
2024-02-02T12:45:31-0500	<nitrix>	rendar, A switch statement jumps to a matching case or a default case. You have neither.
2024-02-02T12:45:53-0500	<rendar>	but what is 'defalt' there?!
2024-02-02T12:46:00-0500	<nitrix>	A label.
2024-02-02T12:46:09-0500	<rendar>	oh
2024-02-02T12:46:31-0500	<nitrix>	Insert goto defalt; before the case for an easy example.
2024-02-02T12:46:35-0500	<rendar>	unbelievable how error prone C is, fortunately i use Rust daily
2024-02-02T12:46:44-0500	<rendar>	nitrix, yes clear
2024-02-02T12:46:53-0500	<rendar>	thanks
2024-02-02T12:47:35-0500	<nitrix>	rendar, It's only error prone if you completely ignore your compiler warnings and errors.
2024-02-02T12:48:16-0500	<nitrix>	,cc -Wall -Wextra switch (1) { defalt: }
2024-02-02T12:48:18-0500	<candide>	nitrix: [warning: label 'defalt' defined but not used [-Wunused-label]  warning: unused parameter 'argc' [-Wunused-parameter]  warning: unused parameter 'argv' [-Wunused-parameter]] no output: defalt = <optimized out>
2024-02-02T12:50:46-0500	<candide>	Sanitizers are debugging tools that perform runtime checks to catch bugs in your code. To use them, compile your debug build with gcc/clang with `-fsanitize=address,undefined -g3` and run the resulting binary.
2024-02-02T12:50:46-0500	<pekster>	Between warnings (as shown above, which you should always be using) and ,{sanitizers} modern compilers take a lot of the low-hanging problems out of the realm of surprise and allow far quicker fixes to be applied.
2024-02-02T12:52:01-0500	<gllmr>	Hi, is there a difference between starting X with startx in tty and starting X from .profile ? Or it does exactly the same thing ?
2024-02-02T12:54:19-0500	<rendar>	i see thanks candide
2024-02-02T12:54:28-0500	<candide>	rendar: Yeah, right.

2024-02-02T13:01:13-0500	<lopid>	should essentially be the same
2024-02-02T13:01:58-0500	<lopid>	polkit or something like that may not be happy about it, though
2024-02-02T13:02:49-0500	<lopid>	but i think that it more about how it is started rather than from whence
2024-02-02T13:03:36-0500	<gllmr>	ok, thank you

2024-02-02T13:50:29-0500	<hergertme>	Company: i think one thing that could prevent gnome-terminal from shipping gtk4 this cycle is the whole geometry resizing stuff.  do you have any thoughts on where i should spend time tracking that down?
2024-02-02T13:50:49-0500	<hergertme>	because according to jadahl it seems like it should be possible as the app is in full control of the sizing, at least protocol wise

2024-02-02T13:59:31-0500	<andrewrk>	rockorager, hmm it looks like InitError is meant to be the error set for the init function only
2024-02-02T14:00:12-0500	<rockorager>	andrewrk: yeah I saw that, it just happens to contain all the error needed for an io.Writer, but not for a Reader
2024-02-02T14:00:46-0500	<rockorager>	I know stdlib isn't a priority but maybe a tls.Client.ReadError and tls.Client.WriteError error set would be helpful here
2024-02-02T14:01:07-0500	<andrewrk>	agreed. all those inferred error sets should be changed to explicit ones
2024-02-02T14:15:41-0500	<leeward>	It's a priority if you make a PR to fix it though.
2024-02-02T14:19:53-0500	<uzz>	I think I like GObject even if I don't really consider myself using GTK. Very nice library indeed.
2024-02-02T14:20:24-0500	<feaneron>	it certainly makes C a lot more palatable, imo
2024-02-02T14:20:57-0500	<somercet>	I have a wordwrap function for a treeview cell that calls:
2024-02-02T14:21:01-0500	<somercet>	gtk_tree_view_column_queue_resize (gtk_tree_view_get_column (xccv->tview, TVC_MESSAGE));
2024-02-02T14:21:47-0500	<somercet>	Now, I have a set_property case that changes a datetime format, and then calls the identical code to resize the cell.
2024-02-02T14:22:02-0500	<andrewrk>	I do try to unblock people by keeping on top of the PR queue
2024-02-02T14:22:06-0500	<somercet>	But I get: gtk_tree_view_get_column: assertion 'GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW (tree_view)' failed
2024-02-02T14:22:13-0500	<somercet>	gtk_tree_view_column_queue_resize: assertion 'GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW_COLUMN (tree_column)' failed
2024-02-02T14:22:16-0500	<andrewrk>	as demanding as it can be sometimes... when do *I* get to write code?!
2024-02-02T14:23:21-0500	<somercet>	Now, these are GtkTreeView's. This warning only happens in the _set_properties function.
2024-02-02T14:24:12-0500	<somercet>	And I wondered if it was because the code says, "_set_property (GObject *object,"
2024-02-02T14:24:32-0500	<somercet>	Even though I create a new pointer, cast to my particular GObject.
2024-02-02T14:28:23-0500	<rockorager>	I guess I should have been more specific: I was asking because I probably could do a PR for it but didn't want to willy-nilly send in a PR for tls code ;)
2024-02-02T14:29:16-0500	<somercet>	hey, we've spoken across each other in Hexchat
2024-02-02T14:30:03-0500	<donoban>	hi, I'm installing alpine on a new laptop. I tried to follow this guide for zfs
2024-02-02T14:30:38-0500	<donoban>	(ups) with encrypted datasheets https://gmelikov.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Alpine%20Linux/Root%20on%20ZFS.html and after reboot I get an error on grub
2024-02-02T14:31:04-0500	<donoban>	It doesn't found /alpinelinux/root@/vmlinuz-lts (which seems a pretty weird path)
2024-02-02T14:31:49-0500	<andrewrk>	rockorager, I was thinking about using the type-erased writer and eliminating anytype 
2024-02-02T14:32:16-0500	<somercet>	JanC, you got a moment?
2024-02-02T14:32:28-0500	<JanC>	?

2024-02-02T14:36:45-0500	<leeward>	Well, I do. Delegation.

2024-02-02T14:41:16-0500	<andrewrk>	but when I delegate something, it doesn't get done exactly how I like it ;)
2024-02-02T14:41:45-0500	<minimal>	donoban: you're trying to install Alpine in an unsupported fashion
2024-02-02T14:42:35-0500	<donoban>	well, I have it running on other server
2024-02-02T14:42:51-0500	<donoban>	I think that I followed the same guide
2024-02-02T14:43:07-0500	<minimal>	and perhaps it doesn't' work now precisely because it's doing something that isn't supported?
2024-02-02T14:43:56-0500	<leeward>	The only solution is cloning. Make several perfect copies of your most trusted collaborator (yourself) and have each do a little bit of code review and a lot of code writing. There's no other way. Nothing could go wrong.
2024-02-02T14:44:12-0500	<donoban>	it's probably some minor thing :)
2024-02-02T14:44:35-0500	<minimal>	just because it may have worked with a previous version of Alpine in the past does not mean it will necessarily work with newer Alpine versions
2024-02-02T14:44:44-0500	<andrewrk>	it would be illuminating to get a pull request from myself. probably humbling
2024-02-02T14:45:04-0500	<minimal>	just because it works to install Alpine does not mean it won't necessarily break in the future with Alpine package updates
2024-02-02T14:45:33-0500	<minimal>	that procedure is doing several "non standard" things
2024-02-02T14:46:04-0500	<hergertme>	somercet: you should be aware of the performance impact of donig that. it can easily create a resize/draw loop
2024-02-02T14:46:13-0500	<donoban>	the "grub workarounds"?
2024-02-02T14:46:40-0500	<minimal>	including modifying a template file packaged by Grub
2024-02-02T14:47:17-0500	<minimal>	so then updated versions of that file won't be installed as part of Grub package updates
2024-02-02T14:47:19-0500	<somercet>	You mean invoking it from the _set_property() func?
2024-02-02T14:47:23-0500	<donoban>	I'm reading on archlinux wiki "Using EFISTUB

2024-02-02T14:48:05-0500	<donoban>	something like

2024-02-02T14:48:15-0500	<somercet>	... no, no.
2024-02-02T14:48:16-0500	<hergertme>	i have some code from a pre-gtk4 gnome-builder that does it though if you need inspiration 
2024-02-02T14:48:26-0500	<somercet>	This is a menuitem that calls the wordwrap
2024-02-02T14:48:35-0500	<donoban>	I'm gonna try to adapt it
2024-02-02T14:48:46-0500	<minimal>	Alpine doesn't "officially" support EFISTUB booting, i.e. setup-disk doesn't support it
2024-02-02T14:48:58-0500	<minimal>	so again, you'd be on your own
2024-02-02T14:49:03-0500	<somercet>	and the other invokes when the datetime cell's format changes.
2024-02-02T14:49:20-0500	<donoban>	is there some supported way for boot encrytped zfs?

2024-02-02T14:50:47-0500	<hergertme>	indedd 
2024-02-02T14:51:01-0500	<hergertme>	you need to be very careful when you potentially queue_resize() from cell renderer stuff 
2024-02-02T14:51:10-0500	<hergertme>	because you could create a soft 100% cpu situation 
2024-02-02T14:51:21-0500	<hergertme>	where you keep looping through asynchronously via the mainloop to do resizing 
2024-02-02T14:51:35-0500	<hergertme>	the best way, if you can do it, is to use GTK 4 and GtkListView or GtkColumnView and real widgets 
2024-02-02T14:51:44-0500	<hergertme>	and just stop using GtkTreeView altogether 
2024-02-02T14:51:51-0500	<seninha>	<nitrix> In theory no
2024-02-02T14:51:54-0500	<seninha>	How so?
2024-02-02T14:52:19-0500	<hergertme>	but if it's as you say, and only in a specific case you queue_resize(), you are probably fine 
2024-02-02T14:52:20-0500	<somercet>	I'm not in a cell_renderer.
2024-02-02T14:52:48-0500	<somercet>	This is an outside object changing the dtformat and telling the TreeView column to resize.
2024-02-02T14:53:31-0500	<hergertme>	but if you're `gtk_tree_view_get_column()` is failing, you need to check your xcv->tview pointer 
2024-02-02T14:53:35-0500	<hergertme>	something is wrong there 
2024-02-02T14:53:52-0500	<hergertme>	xccv*
2024-02-02T14:54:00-0500	<somercet>	the exact same code works without warnings in the same file, in the wordwrap toggle func.
2024-02-02T14:54:17-0500	<hergertme>	perhaps your xccv pointer is wrong 
2024-02-02T14:54:39-0500	<hergertme>	valgrind or -fsanitize=address -lsan to the rescue 
2024-02-02T14:54:45-0500	<hergertme>	err -lasan 
2024-02-02T14:55:25-0500	<somercet>	oh, the datetime column resizes when I change the format. It just issues those two warnings. Every time I do it.
2024-02-02T14:55:41-0500	<minimal>	there's been enough problems recently with Grub on Alpine Edge with "official" install configs without trying to handle 1001 weird/random non-standard installs/configs
2024-02-02T14:56:09-0500	<donoban>	yeah I was thinking that it will be instantly broken after uprading to edge
2024-02-02T14:56:15-0500	<somercet>	Yes, I was asking if the _set_property GObject argument was somehow preventing recasting the GObject to XcChatView.
2024-02-02T14:57:12-0500	<somercet>	but only in the _set_property function, never in the _wordwrap func.
2024-02-02T14:57:21-0500	<minimal>	that's my point
2024-02-02T14:58:00-0500	<somercet>	#GTK is complaining that someone wants to code in GTK, again.
2024-02-02T14:58:52-0500	<hergertme>	you might need to paste a bit more of your code, it's hard to see from just warnings 
2024-02-02T14:59:42-0500	<donoban>	uhm this looks interesting https://github.com/zbm-dev/zfsbootmenu?tab=readme-ov-file
2024-02-02T15:00:43-0500	<somercet>	hang on
2024-02-02T15:01:16-0500	<minimal>	again not supports by setup-disk and I don't think it is even packaged for Alpine
2024-02-02T15:02:41-0500	<donoban>	yes yes
2024-02-02T15:02:58-0500	<somercet>	https://tpaste.us/d1Dx
2024-02-02T15:03:40-0500	<donoban>	looking at setup-disk source, the process for install with zfs doesn't look straighforward
2024-02-02T15:04:08-0500	<minimal>	compared to that "random" document you linked to earlier? ;-)
2024-02-02T15:05:47-0500	<donoban>	I don't feel that it handles the zfs partitioning, pools/datahset creations etc...
2024-02-02T15:08:51-0500	<minimal>	nope, once you move away from ext4 then setup-disk doesn't necessarily do everything for other "supported" filesystems
2024-02-02T15:09:10-0500	<donoban>	well my currennt problem is that it doesn't find --set=root c8ca0d36b8e712fc , I will try to find the right id
2024-02-02T15:09:32-0500	<hergertme_>	maybe through in there a g_assert (GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW (xccv->tview)); ?
2024-02-02T15:09:36-0500	<minimal>	"lsblk"
2024-02-02T15:09:39-0500	<donoban>	I have to go now, thanks for trying to help
2024-02-02T15:09:39-0500	<minimal>	or "blkid"
2024-02-02T15:10:00-0500	<donoban>	will check, it's powered off now
2024-02-02T15:10:06-0500	<donoban>	see you
2024-02-02T15:10:43-0500	<somercet>	one sec
2024-02-02T15:10:56-0500	<hergertme_>	you can also probably drop the GTK_TREE_VIEW_COLUMN() cast, as get_column() already returns the right object type 
2024-02-02T15:11:07-0500	<hergertme_>	but functionally, i dont see anything wrong with what you got there 
2024-02-02T15:11:20-0500	<hergertme_>	so there *must* be something wrong with your xccv->tview pointer 
2024-02-02T15:11:51-0500	<hergertme_>	ie: bad ref counting, or it's NULL, or a stray memory corruption, or the XcChatView itself got disposed/finalized incorrectly already
2024-02-02T15:12:08-0500	<hergertme_>	but throwing an assertion in there will help you determine that and you can work back from there 
2024-02-02T15:13:09-0500	<somercet>	assertion failed: (GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW (xccv->tview))
2024-02-02T15:13:34-0500	<hergertme_>	yup, so either tview is NULL or it's corrupted and/or dangling pointer 
2024-02-02T15:13:49-0500	*	user03 is now known as gchound
2024-02-02T15:13:50-0500	<hergertme_>	you might just check g_assert (xccv->tview != NULL); first 
2024-02-02T15:14:09-0500	<hergertme_>	and if it's null, you gotta figure out why it wasn't set (like missing a gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child(), etc)
2024-02-02T15:14:26-0500	<hergertme_>	if it isn't NULL, you gotta a reference count issue to uncover 
2024-02-02T15:15:42-0500	<NRK>	seninha: what are you trying to do anyways? could just keep it simple and use p[pair(2,1)] instead.
2024-02-02T15:15:42-0500	<hergertme_>	Company: i notice with NGL (on asahi GL) that window resizes are much "clunkier" than GL
2024-02-02T15:16:02-0500	<hergertme_>	like they drop frames regularly where old GL renderer doesn't 
2024-02-02T15:16:08-0500	<hergertme_>	no idea why, ofc 
2024-02-02T15:16:46-0500	<somercet>	if the tview was NULL, then changing wordwrap would not work.
2024-02-02T15:18:20-0500	<seninha>	NRK. I am just thinking whether that is portable, or the standard permits that kind of casting to be problematic.  In the actual code I am just using a `long *p`, looping through it with `for (i=0; i<len; i+=2)` and accessing `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` to access each member of each pair.
2024-02-02T15:18:39-0500	<hergertme_>	somercet: if its a ref issue, anything could work until you break the ref count 
2024-02-02T15:21:57-0500	<jeho>	is it essential to remove the floating reference on objects
2024-02-02T15:22:13-0500	<hergertme_>	GTK will automatically sink floating references when you add them 
2024-02-02T15:22:13-0500	<jeho>	blahblah_ref_sink()
2024-02-02T15:22:51-0500	<jeho>	so they only stick around until the object gets passed to a gtk function i assume
2024-02-02T15:23:26-0500	<hergertme_>	technically if you had a badly implemented widget, calling it's whatever_add() could sink, and release the object
2024-02-02T15:23:40-0500	<hergertme_>	i would say that's bad form, but possible 
2024-02-02T15:23:51-0500	<leeward>	What the heck is going on? `if (optional_thing) |unwrapped| { only_executes_if_not_null; }` <-- Is there something wrong with this?
2024-02-02T15:24:01-0500	<leeward>	https://zigbin.io/2900ed
2024-02-02T15:24:17-0500	<hergertme_>	if you want to keep a pointer to an object that something else controls, you may want to keep your own reference to it (or use a weak-ref like g_object_add_weak_pointer() or g_object_weak_ref() or GWeakRef). so many choices!
2024-02-02T15:24:19-0500	<leeward>	This is what my debugger is telling me, which is disconcerting.
2024-02-02T15:24:44-0500	<jeho>	alright.. i think i got it. thanks
2024-02-02T15:24:45-0500	<hergertme_>	in most cases, you just want to use a template .ui file and gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource()
2024-02-02T15:25:54-0500	<jeho>	oh.. so defining the ui components in xml
2024-02-02T15:26:33-0500	<hergertme_>	i generally try to do it in the XML format because it's a lot easier to forward-port xml files than C source code 
2024-02-02T15:27:02-0500	<hergertme_>	for example, we built tools for updating 3.x to 4.x XML files. harder to do for C
2024-02-02T15:27:02-0500	<jeho>	GtkBuilder and Glade.. was Glade the xml solution preceding GtkBuilder?
2024-02-02T15:27:14-0500	<hergertme_>	glade is an app, GtkBuilder is the .ui format 
2024-02-02T15:27:25-0500	<jeho>	right
2024-02-02T15:27:32-0500	<jeho>	wysiwyg app
2024-02-02T15:27:33-0500	<hergertme_>	Glade can help you build the XML .ui for gtk 3.x 
2024-02-02T15:27:39-0500	<hergertme_>	but i find it easier to just write XML 
2024-02-02T15:28:12-0500	*	hergertme_ afk for a bit, need to do some macos testing
2024-02-02T15:28:23-0500	<jeho>	I thought that way back there was a Glade api you had to call when constructing the application loop 
2024-02-02T15:28:38-0500	<jeho>	that would read in the xml files generated with the glade app
2024-02-02T15:32:41-0500	<jadahl>	hergertme: is it about the "discete" resize thing? it was IIRC a design decision by Company to not support that in gtk4
2024-02-02T15:34:41-0500	<somercet>	solution: move the g_settings_bind() south of adding the GtkTreeView and Columns.
2024-02-02T15:36:28-0500	<somercet>	which I get, for the first warnings, odd that it kept generating that error as I edited the dtformat in dconf-editor.
2024-02-02T15:36:45-0500	<somercet>	c;est la vie.
2024-02-02T15:39:47-0500	<leio>	jeho: that was before gtk 2.12
2024-02-02T15:40:16-0500	<somercet>	ugh, fixed the damned warnings.
2024-02-02T15:40:33-0500	<leio>	with *.glade files (also XML inside, but different format)
2024-02-02T15:42:15-0500	<somercet>	What a God damned pain...

2024-02-02T15:47:35-0500	<Company>	hergertme: it's not gonna happen in GTK4
2024-02-02T15:48:07-0500	<Company>	at least I dont see anyone rewriting the layout system in an API compatible way that makes that possible
2024-02-02T15:48:29-0500	<Company>	for all I care gnome-terminal can keep using GTK3 forever if that's a blocker
2024-02-02T15:48:57-0500	<Company>	someone cn go and fork it and ship a version that can't do it
2024-02-02T15:49:18-0500	<nitrix>	The reason why I'm worried is you're only supposed to convert a pointer to a `void *` to then convert it back to its original type. There's no guarantee that there's a meaningful valid conversion between the representation of a `long *` and the representation of a `long (*)[2]`.
2024-02-02T15:50:12-0500	<nitrix>	So it's implementation-defined, but there's no implementation that I know of that would be so intentionally obtuse about it.
2024-02-02T15:54:40-0500	<leeward>	Ok, it looks like that was just the debugger being super weird.
2024-02-02T15:57:59-0500	<leeward>	Aaaand pebkac, as expected.
2024-02-02T15:58:59-0500	<nitrix>	As for the rest, there's a couple more clauses involved, like not having pointers that point one-past the end of an array, overlapping objects with compatible types, etc. As far as I know those would be fine.
2024-02-02T16:03:50-0500	<jeho>	ah.. thanks leio

2024-02-02T18:02:33-0500	<ossifrage>	I'm a C programmer stuck doing C++ today, and I don't understand why g++/fortified is complaining about a strncpy(dest, input, sizeof(dest))
2024-02-02T18:02:53-0500	<ossifrage>	with: .../string_fortified.h:95:34: warning: 'char* __builtin_strncpy(char*, const char*, unsigned int)' specified bound 16 equals destination size [-Wstringop-truncation]
2024-02-02T18:04:08-0500	<ossifrage>	The strncpy() man page even gives "strncpy(buf2, "Hello world!", sizeof(buf2));" as an example
2024-02-02T18:04:29-0500	<bubuche87>	What is the type of dest ?
2024-02-02T18:04:49-0500	<ossifrage>	char dest[16] = {};
2024-02-02T18:04:53-0500	<bubuche87>	Maybe (just maybe) dest is something like char[16]
2024-02-02T18:05:16-0500	<bubuche87>	And input is something like char[whatever less than 16]
2024-02-02T18:05:35-0500	<bubuche87>	It would be a smart move from the compiler to detect that though.
2024-02-02T18:05:42-0500	<madx>	constxqt: no, but you could do "some_global_var = 42; exit(some_global_var);"
2024-02-02T18:06:04-0500	<ossifrage>	The source is extern char *, (optarg)
2024-02-02T18:07:41-0500	<bubuche87>	Hm. It mentions "Wstringop-truncation". Let me Google that (not "for you" - I am investigating)
2024-02-02T18:08:31-0500	<ossifrage>	eg https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50198319/gcc-8-wstringop-truncation-what-is-the-good-practice
2024-02-02T18:09:13-0500	<bubuche87>	strncpy is a dangerous function that does not null terminate the destination string in case you copy the same amount of characters as the specified buffer size.
2024-02-02T18:09:24-0500	<bubuche87>	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59250031/strncpy-gcc-gives-werror-stringop-truncation

2024-02-02T18:11:08-0500	<bubuche77>	What I quoted seems to imply that when it's NOT the case it null terminates the copy ? I doubt so but let's investigate that

2024-02-03T08:25:31-0500	<bliminse>	NRK: can you attach gdb to your TUI program? Run it, get its PID, then launch gdb from different terminal with -p flag and debug as usual
2024-02-03T08:26:03-0500	<bliminse>	I've used that approach a few times when debugging a terminfo-based app I wrote, not sure if it fits what you have...
2024-02-03T08:28:37-0500	<NRK>	yes. that's what i ended up doing. but it's a massive pain having to do that on every restart
2024-02-03T08:29:12-0500	<NRK>	if there was some way to do `attach $(pidof <progname>)` then that might've been a okayish workaround.

2024-02-03T08:37:39-0500	<bliminse>	I think you can do that when calling it instead of once running, i.e., gdb my-tui-program `pidof my-tui-program` instead of attach <my-pid> inside gdb
2024-02-03T08:38:23-0500	<bliminse>	it's kinda hacky in the sense it won't work if you have multiple instances running, but may simplify your life NRK

2024-02-03T09:04:46-0500	<NRK>	gdb still prints some warning, but input seems to be working fine.
2024-02-03T09:08:18-0500	<ninewise>	I did a BOF last year, in the end I just gave a demo to 3 people who'd never used it on the laptop of a friend

2024-02-03T09:17:23-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	i +='d an uninitialized integer deep in my program and gcc didn't catch it. reeeee.
2024-02-03T09:21:52-0500	<kurahaupo>	SymbioticFemale: sounds like you're looking for a sanitizer rather than (or as well as) a debugger
2024-02-03T09:22:20-0500	<pragma->	A compiler ought to easily be able to tell when an uninitialized value is being used.
2024-02-03T09:22:42-0500	<pragma->	But since it's SymbioticFemale I doubt what they're saying. They probably did initialize it somewhere.
2024-02-03T09:23:26-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	no, its not initialized. its declared, then there is an if statement, then it gets +='d
2024-02-03T09:23:43-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	then bad things happen lol
2024-02-03T09:25:26-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	i've got appropriate flags to catch it but this particular one just isn't getting caught.
2024-02-03T09:30:47-0500	<lm->	SymbioticFemale: can you reproduce this on godbolt? I'm quite curious what is going on there
2024-02-03T09:36:45-0500	<blackpirate>	Hi
2024-02-03T09:36:47-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	i can't reproduce it. it only occurs deep in my program. if i recreate the circumstances in a small example program, gcc catches it.
2024-02-03T09:36:50-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	i'm just here to vent lol.
2024-02-03T09:37:07-0500	<blackpirate>	Anything knows smth about mutlithread programming?
2024-02-03T09:37:15-0500	<blackpirate>	Anybody*
2024-02-03T09:40:17-0500	<dodobrain>	SymbioticFemale, what do you mean? the moment you remove all the unnecessary files and limit it to a single file gcc already catches it?
2024-02-03T09:40:29-0500	<dodobrain>	if yes, pragma- is likely correct

2024-02-03T09:44:56-0500	<Xgc>	SymbioticFemale: Is the repository public?  It's tough to review without full detail.
2024-02-03T09:45:24-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	its not. i'm going to review it again.
2024-02-03T09:46:31-0500	<lm->	or it's just a spaghetti code and gcc bugs out. I remember that once I complicated my c++ code so much with dynamic casts and whatnot, that gcc refused to compile the code (gcc said, he cannot do it, and that it's probably bug in gcc)
2024-02-03T09:46:51-0500	*	pragma- snorts derisively
2024-02-03T09:47:37-0500	<lm->	hey, I was young and fresh out of corporation, ok?
2024-02-03T09:47:48-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	i'm going to either admit that its my fault or i'm going to make it reproducable. give me a bit here.
2024-02-03T09:56:07-0500	<nicos>	Hi. How should I read a char from a file descriptor with zig? something like `read(fd, buf, 1);`
2024-02-03T09:56:38-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	ok i can reproduce it
2024-02-03T10:01:35-0500	<somercet>	does sanitize catch it?
2024-02-03T10:03:04-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	no on the following: -fsanitize=thread -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=float-cast-overflow -fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
2024-02-03T10:03:20-0500	<somercet>	ouchie
2024-02-03T10:04:50-0500	<sonya>	SymbioticFemale: what about clang, pcc or other than gcc? if there's an easy option of course..
2024-02-03T10:05:51-0500	<pragma->	Just ask for the testcase so you can play with it. Why do you take their word for anything?
2024-02-03T10:06:11-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	on its way
2024-02-03T10:06:25-0500	<sonya>	roger that!
2024-02-03T10:07:29-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	https://paste.debian.net/plain/1306193
2024-02-03T10:08:42-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	cc has the same behavior as gcc
2024-02-03T10:08:57-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	(fails to detect)
2024-02-03T10:10:20-0500	<pragma->	we don't know what your cc is linked at
2024-02-03T10:10:29-0500	<kurahaupo>	Which cc?
2024-02-03T10:11:34-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	derp
2024-02-03T10:11:47-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	my cc is linked to gcc
2024-02-03T10:11:52-0500	<pragma->	smh
2024-02-03T10:12:18-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	so yeah, clang catches it
2024-02-03T10:13:22-0500	<Forza>	Is it possinle to prevent gnome-apps-core from depending on fwupd, or st least prevent it from starting fwupd automatically?
2024-02-03T10:13:30-0500	*	Forza hi
2024-02-03T10:13:44-0500	<mclasen>	Company: I made the subsurface clip search more general
2024-02-03T10:14:10-0500	<ikke>	What is starting fwupd automatically?
2024-02-03T10:14:45-0500	<tarxvfz>	> but if no other current users show up...
2024-02-03T10:15:10-0500	<sonya>	SymbioticFemale: clang-13 : https://clbin.com/m2KLT
2024-02-03T10:15:28-0500	<tarxvfz>	hey what this means? it sounds scarry :) I am a relatively new user! And I love vis :)
2024-02-03T10:16:05-0500	<pragma->	smh clbin with the expired tls cert
2024-02-03T10:16:06-0500	<tarxvfz>	I put my whole strategy for my IDE around vis and do not want to go back to other vi* editors :)
2024-02-03T10:16:39-0500	<pragma->	sonya: use more -lpthread or whatever
2024-02-03T10:17:59-0500	<lm->	SymbioticFemale: nice, does indeed look like gcc bug to me, I'd report that for some fame
2024-02-03T10:18:15-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	lol
2024-02-03T10:19:06-0500	<kurahaupo>	SymbioticFemale: did you have -Wmaybe-uninitialized (or equivalent)?
2024-02-03T10:19:27-0500	<lm->	does not change anything, still no warning
2024-02-03T10:19:41-0500	<lm->	basicailly gcc and tiny c compiler do not report about that
2024-02-03T10:19:55-0500	<lm->	rest compilers on godbolt print warning

2024-02-03T10:20:53-0500	<Forza>	Gnome desktop, something
2024-02-03T10:21:25-0500	<Forza>	When i try apk del fwupd it says gnome depends on it.
2024-02-03T10:21:35-0500	<kurahaupo>	pragma-: isn't that t for toy?
2024-02-03T10:21:45-0500	<Forza>	When i reboot it gets started when i have logged in 
2024-02-03T10:22:40-0500	<Forza>	The init script for fwupd is disabled
2024-02-03T10:23:23-0500	<zcrayfish>	the init script isn't needed for KDE or Gnome desktop users.
2024-02-03T10:23:52-0500	<ikke>	You could do `apk add -t fwupd`, which installs fwupd as a virtual package. But if something tries to run fwupd, it will fail
2024-02-03T10:25:30-0500	<Forza>	Hm that's an ideq
2024-02-03T10:25:38-0500	<mclasen>	hergertme: quite an article. Thanks for getting it out!
2024-02-03T10:25:40-0500	<xx0a_q>	.
2024-02-03T10:25:58-0500	<Forza>	I did chmod -x. But I don't know if that cause issues 
2024-02-03T10:26:27-0500	<Forza>	This is a vm so it is rather not necessary to have fwupd :) 
2024-02-03T10:26:54-0500	<Xgc>	SymbioticFemale: Depends on the options, most likely. clang 17.0.6, default options, doesn't catch it.
2024-02-03T10:27:44-0500	<zcrayfish>	ah
2024-02-03T10:28:11-0500	<SymbioticFemale>	clang 14.0.6 catches it with -Wall
2024-02-03T10:28:25-0500	<lm->	Xgc: -Wall -Wextra -Werror are default options
2024-02-03T10:28:38-0500	<lm->	ok, maybe no -Werror but only on prod
2024-02-03T10:28:38-0500	<pragma->	except without -Werror
2024-02-03T10:28:47-0500	<Xgc>	Yes. It does.  Bit as I said, depends on options used.
2024-02-03T10:30:24-0500	<Company>	article?
2024-02-03T10:30:57-0500	<Company>	oh, Fedora Magazine
2024-02-03T10:31:48-0500	<Forza>	Hm https://gist.tnonline.net/YU 
2024-02-03T10:32:40-0500	<ikke>	Oh, a soname dependency
2024-02-03T10:32:43-0500	<ikke>	then you cannot get rid of it
2024-02-03T10:32:56-0500	<sonya>	-Wall for clang-13.0 catches the error too
2024-02-03T10:33:30-0500	<mclasen>	yup
2024-02-03T10:33:42-0500	<sonya>	pcc -Wall builds a binary though..
2024-02-03T10:33:49-0500	<pragma->	anyway, "default options" means no options, imo. "common options" would be -Wall et al.
2024-02-03T10:34:02-0500	<Company>	the first comment is the best one
2024-02-03T10:34:10-0500	<pragma->	still dumb that warnings are opt-in instead of opt-out.
2024-02-03T10:34:52-0500	<pragma->	"default" means "out-of-the-box", which means no warnings enabled.
2024-02-03T10:34:54-0500	*	pragma- shrugs.
2024-02-03T10:35:00-0500	<mclasen>	I have no idea how big the overlap between the fedora magazine and phoronix commenter pools
2024-02-03T10:35:10-0500	<mclasen>	but evidently, it can't be empty
2024-02-03T10:35:44-0500	<Forza>	:/ isn't it a little weird that there's a hard dependency on it? 
2024-02-03T10:35:59-0500	<Company>	I love how they were so angry, they installed it just so they could rant about how they're too stupid to use it without reading any docs
2024-02-03T10:36:04-0500	<lm->	sure, you can also buy a PC, and have no OS which is default
2024-02-03T10:36:07-0500	<lm->	:]
2024-02-03T10:36:21-0500	<mclasen>	Company: ebassi and I talked a bit more about the image loader situation over lunch
2024-02-03T10:36:50-0500	<Company>	and?
2024-02-03T10:36:59-0500	<mclasen>	one thought that came up is that we should have a singing-and-dancing paintable implementation
2024-02-03T10:37:21-0500	<Company>	a what?
2024-02-03T10:37:24-0500	<mclasen>	ideally, it would live with proper loader implementations, like in glycin
2024-02-03T10:37:26-0500	<pragma->	Pretty sure there are some built-in warnings that are still active without any -W.
2024-02-03T10:37:37-0500	<mclasen>	a paintable that does all the smart things
2024-02-03T10:37:43-0500	<Company>	you mean a paintable that does progressive and async loading and such?
2024-02-03T10:37:43-0500	<mclasen>	async, in threads, header first, whatever
2024-02-03T10:38:01-0500	<zcrayfish>	What's even more weird is if you go to the app center and disable all the repos in gnome, it still launches fwupd. 
2024-02-03T10:38:12-0500	<zcrayfish>	(I mean all the fwupd repos)
2024-02-03T10:38:16-0500	<Company>	yeah, that should live in glycin
2024-02-03T10:38:20-0500	<mclasen>	if we can't convince sophie to put such a thing into glycin, one could make a libpaintable
2024-02-03T10:38:22-0500	*	neiluj_ is now known as neiluj
2024-02-03T10:38:36-0500	<mclasen>	since we all agree that it shouldn't live in gtk
2024-02-03T10:38:48-0500	*	pragma- thinks -w and -W are backwards
2024-02-03T10:38:58-0500	<Company>	if you do a graphics-focused library, another thing to put there could be thumbnailing
2024-02-03T10:39:14-0500	<mclasen>	we also mused about a bablpaintable for the gimp
2024-02-03T10:39:53-0500	<Company>	I haven't looked much at babl because it was all CPU
2024-02-03T10:40:02-0500	<pragma->	lowercase to enable, uppercase to disable seems rather common in command-line tools aside from gcc/clang
2024-02-03T10:40:19-0500	<Xgc>	sonya: If you just want to check the compile (not link), -c will do that. -Wall doesn't change that behavior.
2024-02-03T10:40:31-0500	<Company>	but 2 things that could be interesting with babl are textures with a get_pixels() callback
2024-02-03T10:40:40-0500	<Xgc>	For gcc and clang, that is.
2024-02-03T10:41:03-0500	<Company>	and adding a source rectangle to that callback
2024-02-03T10:41:22-0500	<Xgc>	That would be odd for any compiler to change that behavior with -Wall
2024-02-03T10:41:32-0500	<mclasen>	a roi
2024-02-03T10:42:15-0500	<Company>	you only need the rect for large content that you want to partially upload
2024-02-03T10:42:37-0500	<Company>	which is irrelevant 90% of the time
2024-02-03T10:42:43-0500	<Company>	or even 99% of time
2024-02-03T10:42:55-0500	<Company>	and the problem with the callback is that it runs in the main thread
2024-02-03T10:43:22-0500	<Company>	and that is exactly what you don't want here
2024-02-03T10:43:35-0500	<q66>	why do you care if it's installed in the first place 
2024-02-03T10:43:43-0500	<Company>	so it's a bit questionable if you actually do want these concepts
2024-02-03T10:44:01-0500	<Company>	but it does allow you to release the memory when you no longer need it
2024-02-03T10:44:21-0500	<Company>	and it does allow you to hook into fancier providers than GBytes
2024-02-03T10:44:26-0500	<Company>	like tiles
2024-02-03T10:44:44-0500	*	jfsimon1981 is now known as jfsimon
2024-02-03T10:44:56-0500	<Company>	though you could still hide that in a paintable, by just using multiple textures
2024-02-03T10:45:19-0500	<mclasen>	have you thought any further about about our more immediate tiling needs?
2024-02-03T10:45:38-0500	<Forza>	Uses ram. Keeps connecting to remote server 
2024-02-03T10:45:59-0500	<Company>	I have tried to not think about anything (and intend to do that while you're all in Brussels)
2024-02-03T10:46:13-0500	<mclasen>	leaving brussels monday morning
2024-02-03T10:46:26-0500	<Company>	I'm still noticing I'm stressed
2024-02-03T10:46:40-0500	<zcrayfish>	Remove the fwupd repos. Latter problem solved.
2024-02-03T10:46:58-0500	<Company>	and I don't want to start being aggressive in bug reports due to that
2024-02-03T10:47:05-0500	<mclasen>	good call
2024-02-03T10:47:07-0500	<Company>	and I've noticed it happening
2024-02-03T10:47:15-0500	<ninewise>	just that it made the meetup at FOSDEM more of a demo rather than a discussion
2024-02-03T10:47:50-0500	<Company>	but my immediate primary concern is still debugging the fractional scaling glitches
2024-02-03T10:47:50-0500	<mclasen>	good idea to take the weekend off
2024-02-03T10:48:04-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, that is also a thing we need
2024-02-03T10:48:08-0500	<Company>	and then large iamges
2024-02-03T10:48:13-0500	<mclasen>	here's the hackfest summary, btw: https://blog.gtk.org/2024/02/03/gtk-hackfest-updates/
2024-02-03T10:48:46-0500	<zcrayfish>	# rm -rf /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/*.conf 
2024-02-03T10:50:35-0500	<Company>	is there anything you discussed that I should be involved in that's worth doing a call about before you forget it?
2024-02-03T10:51:12-0500	<Company>	the summary doesn't look like it at least
2024-02-03T10:51:27-0500	<helene>	nicos: sounds OS-specific, you should be able to get the syscalls from std.os iirc
2024-02-03T10:52:13-0500	<mclasen>	We haven't really touched on rendering at all
2024-02-03T10:52:35-0500	<Company>	could have been things like listview, too
2024-02-03T10:52:43-0500	<helene>	just encountered a funny bug on latest zig (0.12.0-dev.2543+9eda6ccef); lld explodes if i do a `zig build --help` while my current working directory goes through a symlink
2024-02-03T10:52:45-0500	<mclasen>	We had some discussion with Sonny and Tobias about stf, the work thats happening there, and the relationship between gtk and libadwaita
2024-02-03T10:52:47-0500	<Company>	or HDR
2024-02-03T10:52:57-0500	<helene>	is that a known bug? (it's on aarch64 fedora)
2024-02-03T10:53:19-0500	<mclasen>	one thing he said is the alice is mostly done with the sheet dialog work (but that all goes into libadwaita)
2024-02-03T10:53:29-0500	<mclasen>	and will get back to the css variables soon
2024-02-03T10:53:45-0500	<mclasen>	so we should probably plan some time to review and land that early next cycle
2024-02-03T10:54:03-0500	<Company>	I have no idea how close that is to merging
2024-02-03T10:54:18-0500	<mclasen>	sure, we'll find out when we review it
2024-02-03T10:54:31-0500	<sdk_>	This struct here as a member declared as "char payload[0];". An array with 0 elements.... so... just a pointer?
2024-02-03T10:54:45-0500	<Company>	the part that is hardest to quantify but probably most interesting, is the performance question
2024-02-03T10:54:51-0500	<fizzie>	Arrays aren't pointers.
2024-02-03T10:54:56-0500	<Company>	conformance is easy to test
2024-02-03T10:55:00-0500	<fizzie>	And zero-length arrays are a nonstandard extension.
2024-02-03T10:55:04-0500	<mclasen>	we talked a bit about plumbing bits landing in libadwaita, and how maybe some of it should find its way back into gtk
2024-02-03T10:55:34-0500	<fizzie>	C99 introduced a thing called a /flexible array member/ to serve the same purpose that almost certainly a `char payload[0];` was for.
2024-02-03T10:55:51-0500	<Company>	the question about which bits should go in Adwaita and which should go in GTK is still unsolved
2024-02-03T10:56:02-0500	<candide>	The last element of a structure with more than one named member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a flexible array member (C99 6.7.2.1p16). struct s { int n; double d[]; } *p = malloc(sizeof *p + 17 * sizeof *p->d);

2024-02-03T10:56:13-0500	<sdk_>	thans for the catch phrase zero lenght array. I found the docs: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html
2024-02-03T10:56:36-0500	<Forza>	Hm. Not sure. It still starts unless I remove exec bit on it
2024-02-03T10:56:50-0500	<Company>	we're pulling more of the lower layers into GTK, so it might me worth pushing more of the upper layers into adwaita
2024-02-03T10:57:11-0500	<Company>	like, we've pulled Cairo, and we're about to pull Pango and half of freetype
2024-02-03T10:57:52-0500	<Company>	and we're pulling those without the associated developers
2024-02-03T10:58:19-0500	<emanuele6>	i don't like that vis's :! is not like vim's
2024-02-03T10:58:41-0500	<mclasen>	well, there are no cairo developers to pull, and the pango developer is already here
2024-02-03T10:58:52-0500	<emanuele6>	vis's is like nvim's; it does not actually run the command in the terminal, so you cannot use stuff like   :!git add -p   and similar
2024-02-03T10:59:15-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-02-03T10:59:41-0500	<mclasen>	and we've pretty much shed ux development entirely
2024-02-03T11:00:11-0500	<emanuele6>	hmm, git add -p works actually
2024-02-03T11:00:17-0500	<Company>	the layout stuff is still here
2024-02-03T11:00:21-0500	<Company>	and so are the dialogs
2024-02-03T11:00:49-0500	<somercet>	"in the terminal", you mean, in the shell?
2024-02-03T11:00:55-0500	<Company>	"layout stuff" mostly meaning containers like flowbox, listbox, etc
2024-02-03T11:01:01-0500	<emanuele6>	no. i mean in the terminal.
2024-02-03T11:01:10-0500	<mclasen>	we've reduced the dialogs to async portal apis
2024-02-03T11:01:24-0500	<emanuele6>	i don't remember what i did the other day, i tried to run an interactive command with   :!   and it opened a split instead of running it in the terminal so i could not interact with it
2024-02-03T11:01:34-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, we still have a core set of widgets
2024-02-03T11:01:39-0500	<Company>	not sure about the list stuff - you could probably shed that too, but only as a whole thing, it doesn't use much private API
2024-02-03T11:01:41-0500	<mclasen>	and some complex things
2024-02-03T11:02:49-0500	<Company>	my point is that we'd need more people if we wanted to shed less - or we'd need to stop pulling in things
2024-02-03T11:04:30-0500	<Company>	we could pull all of Adwaita with the developers - but not sure how well that'd work with the pace of Adwaita
2024-02-03T11:04:54-0500	<Company>	they've had like 3 UI refreshes already, and we're still at GTK 4.12
2024-02-03T11:05:30-0500	<emanuele6>	s/a split/& with the commands output after it terminated/
2024-02-03T11:07:44-0500	<mclasen>	yeah, I don't want to pull all of libadwaita
2024-02-03T11:08:04-0500	<falsifian>	mcepl: I see a missing closing ' on each of the two added lines in that diff.
2024-02-03T11:08:54-0500	<mcepl>	let me take a look. any idea how to do g~ with awk?

2024-02-03T11:09:31-0500	<emanuele6>	somercet: why are you even asking that question? vis's :! does use a shell
2024-02-03T11:10:26-0500	<falsifian>	mcepl: I don't have much vis-fu. I guess the challenge is you want it to accept a movement command following the alias? I don't know how to do that.
2024-02-03T11:10:50-0500	<mcepl>	it is not about vis-fu, but about awk-fu.
2024-02-03T11:11:06-0500	<falsifian>	Oops, I was confusing it with g~ in vim I guess, which accepts a movement. I miss taht.
2024-02-03T11:11:28-0500	<falsifian>	Won't the same thing work? tolower seems to accept a string, not just one character.
2024-02-03T11:11:36-0500	<falsifian>	Oh, you want to swap case
2024-02-03T11:11:53-0500	<falsifian>	sorry awake now
2024-02-03T11:12:04-0500	<Forza>	And I guess future updates will overwrite / add back those files
2024-02-03T11:12:27-0500	<mcepl>	we have in vis now g~ implemented by `tr '[:lower:][:upper:]' '[:upper:][:lower:]'`, but I have no idea how to do it with awk(1).
2024-02-03T11:12:48-0500	<ikke>	yes
2024-02-03T11:13:33-0500	<zcrayfish>	maybe it would be better to blank them.
2024-02-03T11:13:42-0500	<falsifian>	Hm, maybe something with the match function in a loop. Looks like it can take a regex.
2024-02-03T11:13:43-0500	<Forza>	I saw a thread on debian forums about it. They have libfwupd as separate package

2024-02-03T11:18:24-0500	<ikke>	Sounds like an xy problem though. The real solution would be an option in gnome-apps-core to disable it
2024-02-03T11:18:38-0500	<ikke>	Not by sabotaging the fwupd binary
2024-02-03T11:19:30-0500	<nicos>	thanks 
2024-02-03T11:19:55-0500	<mcepl>	I had `sed -E 's/([[:lower:]])|([[:upper:]])/\U\1\L\2/g'` with sed, but now I wonder how to write in awk(1).
2024-02-03T11:20:32-0500	<mcepl>	(I was shot down, because GNU sed is too different from *BSD sed)
2024-02-03T11:20:59-0500	<falsifian>	I am trying to do something with awk. So far I have managed to make OpenBSD's awk segfault...
2024-02-03T11:21:10-0500	<mcepl>	:(
2024-02-03T11:21:16-0500	<hergertme>	Company: yeah i had to really hold myself back re that first comment 
2024-02-03T11:21:36-0500	<hergertme>	"everything looks bad in WindowMaker" crossed my mind 
2024-02-03T11:22:06-0500	<hergertme>	but the entirety of inability to run --help 
2024-02-03T11:22:23-0500	<hergertme>	the entitlement goes extremely deep in that person 
2024-02-03T11:22:48-0500	<zcrayfish>	they don't even have a gsetting to do so. insane.
2024-02-03T11:24:04-0500	<falsifian>	Making progress. Have to go now but here's what I have so far; seems to partly work: https://bsd.ac/2zp2vvn
2024-02-03T11:24:21-0500	<ikke>	Forza: what I'm wondering is whether it is even calling the binary if it directly links against the library
2024-02-03T11:24:23-0500	<Forza>	Yes probably. But at the moment we can't. From the thread I read gnome only really depends on the lib and not the daemon, that's why it got split in two packages 
2024-02-03T11:24:24-0500	<falsifian>	The idea is sc_low lower-cases the first few upper-case characters then hands it off to sc_up, etc, back and forth
2024-02-03T11:24:33-0500	<falsifian>	Might blow the stack. Maybe it should be a loop instead.
2024-02-03T11:24:38-0500	<falsifian>	g2g gl
2024-02-03T11:24:38-0500	<ikke>	right, but doesn't that mean the solution is moot?
2024-02-03T11:25:04-0500	<Company>	that wasn't about entitlement
2024-02-03T11:25:11-0500	<Company>	that was about wanting to hate on something
2024-02-03T11:25:21-0500	<Forza>	I don't know. If we can split the package we don't need the daemon and still keep all deps that gnome needs
2024-02-03T11:25:46-0500	<ikke>	But what are you solving then?
2024-02-03T11:25:56-0500	<ikke>	I mean, it's not a bad idea to split them
2024-02-03T11:26:15-0500	<Forza>	Not having fwupd running automatically when gnome runs
2024-02-03T11:26:44-0500	<mcepl>	it is crazily complicated, comparing it to the elegance of one-liners of tr(1) and sed(1) â¦
2024-02-03T11:26:48-0500	<ikke>	Why does it start the daemon if it does not even need itÂ¿
2024-02-03T11:27:12-0500	<Forza>	To check for updates? 
2024-02-03T11:27:16-0500	<Company>	the good thing is that they use that hate on GTK, and not people
2024-02-03T11:28:00-0500	<Forza>	But maybe there's another way to disable this in gnome, but as zcrayfish said, there's no gsetting for that? 
2024-02-03T11:30:24-0500	<Forza>	It's not an important issue for me personally though. Just was surprised that it was running on my vm when I had disabled the init script. So I googled and found the debian solution. People there were against "call home" apps without asking the user first. 
2024-02-03T11:52:13-0500	<falsifian>	C or lua maybe?

2024-02-03T12:26:26-0500	<hergertme>	i had a number of people really like the article, so i feel like i did fine on it 
2024-02-03T12:26:40-0500	<hergertme>	and at least now i can point people to why their hairbrained ideas wont work for our needs 
2024-02-03T12:34:43-0500	<mclasen>	hergertme: there was some discussion here yesterday about react-style ui development, with some ways to reload the ui and whatnot
2024-02-03T12:36:46-0500	<hergertme>	im certainly not a fan, but i know there are people who are 
2024-02-03T12:41:06-0500	<mclasen>	there was some suggestion that we should handle assertions differently for that
2024-02-03T12:41:15-0500	<mclasen>	essentially throw an exception, I guess
2024-02-03T12:43:16-0500	<hergertme>	i have no idea what that means 
2024-02-03T12:43:29-0500	<hergertme>	g_assert()? or g_return_if_fail()?
2024-02-03T12:44:28-0500	<Company>	assertions cannot happen
2024-02-03T12:44:37-0500	<Company>	so we don't need to handle them
2024-02-03T12:46:21-0500	<Company>	and for the return_if_fail() case, I've suggested multiple times to add validation functions to the introspection data
2024-02-03T12:46:45-0500	<Company>	so react could use that to throw exceptions
2024-02-03T12:48:57-0500	<Company>	that would solve 2 things: the above and it'd get the exception machinery out of the code path that actually knows what it's doing so that code can go fast
2024-02-03T12:49:10-0500	<hergertme>	we could generate a wrapper library true 
2024-02-03T12:49:11-0500	<Company>	technically, you could even build a validation layer ala Vulkan that way
2024-02-03T12:49:39-0500	<hergertme>	but yeah, letting people willy nilly do anything to API incorrectly sounds incredibly ... not bright 
2024-02-03T12:49:49-0500	<Company>	well
2024-02-03T12:49:51-0500	<hergertme>	validation layers seems like a reasonable compromise 
2024-02-03T12:50:10-0500	<Company>	if you want to do builder-like UIs you kinda have to allow that
2024-02-03T12:50:16-0500	<hergertme>	because there is no way people will write good enough C to protect against that 
2024-02-03T12:50:19-0500	<Company>	and tell people when they go wrong
2024-02-03T12:50:45-0500	<hergertme>	im not saying we shouldn't have validation, just that doing it from precondition macros seems like an extremely error prone way to do it 
2024-02-03T12:51:03-0500	<Company>	I'm saying we shouldn't have validation
2024-02-03T12:51:13-0500	<Company>	or rather: we should have no validation
2024-02-03T12:51:17-0500	<Company>	as an option
2024-02-03T12:51:54-0500	<Company>	for 2 reasons: (1) there is code that is absolutely performance-criticial, like inner loops and such
2024-02-03T12:52:06-0500	<hergertme>	id be fine with that if we really had enforcement layers above 
2024-02-03T12:52:22-0500	<Company>	and (2) if validation is togglable, you can make validation even slower and do more work
2024-02-03T12:52:26-0500	<hergertme>	libgtk4-the-good.so 
2024-02-03T12:52:29-0500	<hergertme>	libgtk4-the-bad.so 
2024-02-03T12:52:33-0500	<hergertme>	and we can finally be gstreamer 
2024-02-03T12:53:02-0500	<hergertme>	random aside, i just compared Render/3D overhead on prompt with GL vs NGL
2024-02-03T12:53:04-0500	<Company>	like, the Vulkan validation layers sometimes go 3 objects deep to check that that object is the right one
2024-02-03T12:53:13-0500	<hergertme>	GL can scroll w/ about 5.6% Render/3D 
2024-02-03T12:53:19-0500	<hergertme>	NGL is around 9%
2024-02-03T12:53:27-0500	<hergertme>	alacritty sits nicely at 3% heh
2024-02-03T12:53:39-0500	<hergertme>	but it doesn't kinetic scroll so not fair comparison 
2024-02-03T12:53:46-0500	<Company>	is Render/3D GPU time?
2024-02-03T12:53:51-0500	<hergertme>	i think so
2024-02-03T12:53:54-0500	<hergertme>	Blitter is separate 
2024-02-03T12:54:18-0500	<Company>	I was asking about if you look at CPU or GPU time
2024-02-03T12:54:28-0500	<hergertme>	this is GPU % yeah
2024-02-03T12:54:34-0500	<hergertme>	intel_gpu_top 
2024-02-03T12:54:37-0500	<Company>	ah
2024-02-03T12:54:39-0500	<Company>	yeah
2024-02-03T12:54:51-0500	<Company>	we run too much code on the GPU for simple things
2024-02-03T12:55:03-0500	<Company>	that's why i want the simple path
2024-02-03T12:55:35-0500	<Company>	basically, we do things like bounds checks when blitting glyphs
2024-02-03T12:55:35-0500	<mclasen>	but for scrolling you probably want fractional positions?
2024-02-03T12:55:57-0500	<Company>	because it uses the texture blitter and sometimes you get to the bounds of a texture
2024-02-03T12:56:36-0500	<hergertme>	mclasen: not really currently because all our scrollable implementations are pixel boundaries 
2024-02-03T12:56:49-0500	<hergertme>	none of them effectively use .5 at 2x scale for double :value property 
2024-02-03T12:56:56-0500	<Company>	mclasen: doesn't matter
2024-02-03T12:57:13-0500	<Company>	mclasen: the glyph is transparent at the edge, so we can overdraw and not care about AA just fine
2024-02-03T12:57:13-0500	<hergertme>	for 5.x we should absolutely fix GtkRectangle in GtkTextView for smoother scrolling + VTE 
2024-02-03T12:57:27-0500	<hergertme>	Company: CPU wise, gl = 15% ngl = 17%
2024-02-03T12:57:36-0500	<hergertme>	so slightly less CPU as well as GPU overhead 
2024-02-03T12:57:41-0500	<hergertme>	ofc it's not as correct 
2024-02-03T12:57:46-0500	<Company>	hergertme: that is pretty good for the amount of work NGL does
2024-02-03T12:58:03-0500	<hergertme>	yeah, not trying to imply it isn't 
2024-02-03T12:58:09-0500	<hergertme>	just a "here is were we stand currently" 
2024-02-03T12:58:14-0500	<Company>	I had thought CPU was 30-50% more
2024-02-03T12:58:26-0500	<Company>	how is Vulkan doing?
2024-02-03T12:58:38-0500	<Company>	ie, how much overhead is due to libGL?
2024-02-03T12:59:00-0500	<Company>	on the GPU side, they should be pretty identical
2024-02-03T12:59:17-0500	<Company>	note: should
2024-02-03T12:59:19-0500	<hergertme>	CPU is also 17-19% w/ vulkan 
2024-02-03T12:59:29-0500	<Company>	Vulkan drivers tend to compile shaders wrong
2024-02-03T12:59:43-0500	<Company>	so all the CPU overhead is our fault
2024-02-03T13:00:14-0500	<hergertme>	GPU Render/3d is around 10% and Blitter around 2%
2024-02-03T13:00:23-0500	<hergertme>	so Vulkan, on my Intel ARC uses about same CPU and more GPU 
2024-02-03T13:00:25-0500	<hergertme>	than GL
2024-02-03T13:00:29-0500	<hergertme>	err than NGL even
2024-02-03T13:00:33-0500	<hergertme>	(which had almost no blitter before)
2024-02-03T13:00:46-0500	<Company>	what are you doing actually?
2024-02-03T13:00:50-0500	<Company>	scrolling in prompt?
2024-02-03T13:00:52-0500	<hergertme>	two finger scrolling in prompt 
2024-02-03T13:01:06-0500	<Company>	that is entirely dominated by glyph blitting
2024-02-03T13:01:18-0500	<Company>	well, on the gpu side, there's the background draw, too
2024-02-03T13:01:34-0500	<hergertme>	NGL uses 0 blitter where as vulkan is using it for *something* 
2024-02-03T13:02:02-0500	<hergertme>	in prompt i remove all VTE background draws btw, so it's just the window background 
2024-02-03T13:02:04-0500	<Company>	try GSK_GPU_SKIP=clear to see if it goes away in Vulkan
2024-02-03T13:02:25-0500	<Company>	yeah, the window background is what we use a clear for
2024-02-03T13:02:53-0500	<hergertme>	basically the same 
2024-02-03T13:03:00-0500	<Company>	then it's something the driver does
2024-02-03T13:03:36-0500	<Company>	are you on 23.3 or 24.0?
2024-02-03T13:03:52-0500	<hergertme>	23.3 
2024-02-03T13:04:05-0500	<hergertme>	ill update quick
2024-02-03T13:04:09-0500	<hergertme>	there are 24.0 now 
2024-02-03T13:04:16-0500	<hergertme>	oh wait there are not 
2024-02-03T13:04:18-0500	<hergertme>	23.4 
2024-02-03T13:04:38-0500	<Company>	23.3 GL uses the dmabuf modifier that tracks the clear color
2024-02-03T13:04:43-0500	<Company>	23.3 VUlkan does not
2024-02-03T13:05:09-0500	<Company>	which is why Vulkan can't import GL-created dmabufs in Ephy
2024-02-03T13:05:21-0500	<hergertme>	23.4 does make it better though!
2024-02-03T13:05:22-0500	<Company>	could be that that's why Vulkan does the extra clear in the blitter
2024-02-03T13:05:28-0500	<hergertme>	Blitter dropped to just under 2%
2024-02-03T13:05:37-0500	<hergertme>	and Render/3D into the 8.x% range 
2024-02-03T13:06:21-0500	<Company>	so it's slightly faster than NGL now?
2024-02-03T13:06:26-0500	<Company>	or did NGL also improve?
2024-02-03T13:06:47-0500	<hergertme>	hah but 23.4 makes the old GL renderer better too
2024-02-03T13:07:10-0500	<hergertme>	it drops to 4.0%
2024-02-03T13:07:15-0500	<hergertme>	in Render/3D only 
2024-02-03T13:08:12-0500	<hergertme>	NGL drops to about 6.5% in Render/3D only 
2024-02-03T13:08:23-0500	<Company>	don't check alacritty!
2024-02-03T13:09:03-0500	<hergertme>	both sit around 600 mhz 
2024-02-03T13:09:47-0500	<hergertme>	so here is a difference ... gl has about 330% irq/sec 
2024-02-03T13:10:42-0500	<hergertme>	vulkan is closer to 600
2024-02-03T13:11:03-0500	<hergertme>	still at 600 mhz but many close to double the irq/sec 
2024-02-03T13:11:17-0500	<hergertme>	s/many/maybe 
2024-02-03T13:11:39-0500	<Company>	what do irq/sec tell us?
2024-02-03T13:12:02-0500	<hergertme>	ngl is basically the same as gl though 
2024-02-03T13:12:11-0500	<hergertme>	irq/sec means bottom handlers have to wake up in the kernel?
2024-02-03T13:12:42-0500	<Company>	it's 5/frame vs 10/frame it seems
2024-02-03T13:12:45-0500	<hergertme>	id assume the top handlers are somewhat coalesced 
2024-02-03T13:12:56-0500	<Company>	but no idea what's triggering an irq
2024-02-03T13:13:02-0500	<Company>	that's why I was wondering
2024-02-03T13:14:07-0500	<Company>	like, GTK draws everything and then adds a fence
2024-02-03T13:14:27-0500	<Company>	so I'd expect that fence to cause an irq
2024-02-03T13:14:35-0500	<Company>	but not 10
2024-02-03T13:15:12-0500	<Company>	there's gonna be irqs from the compositor, so the 5 GL ones won't be from the app
2024-02-03T13:15:20-0500	<Company>	or at least not all
2024-02-03T13:16:25-0500	<Company>	but that's driver/kernel stuff, I have no idea how that works
2024-02-03T13:17:08-0500	<Company>	I do know that the Xe work has been redoing the kernel interfaces, similar to the stuff that gfxstrand did for nvk
2024-02-03T13:17:34-0500	<Company>	because she worked on the initial Xe driver before switching to nvk
2024-02-03T13:18:09-0500	<Company>	so it could be that Intel's GL uses the new interface already but Vulkan doesn't on 23.3?
2024-02-03T13:20:43-0500	<hergertme>	could be

2024-02-03T13:44:39-0500	<Xinayder>	huh, I expected something else since I can't open it with an archiver
2024-02-03T13:47:31-0500	<helene>	is there a way to tell zig to never strip debug information or symbols? targetting embedded, i'd like to compile w/ ReleaseSmall but keep all of the advantages of having debug info in the .elf (for gdb purposes)
2024-02-03T13:49:21-0500	<lopid>	maybe the archiver goes by extension 
2024-02-03T13:53:10-0500	<helene>	oops, just needed .strip = false on ExecutableOptions it seems

2024-02-03T14:20:26-0500	<lavaball>	has anyone else had the idea of indenting else? i always do, because it's inside the if and not a new exactly a new block. i never see it anywhere else though. it's about where to put the curly braces.
2024-02-03T14:22:05-0500	<nitrix>	Pick a style and be consistent.'
2024-02-03T14:22:35-0500	<nitrix>	It's common across languages for blocks to have their statements indented to show that the control flow is diverging.
2024-02-03T14:23:50-0500	<lavaball>	yet the else never is.
2024-02-03T14:24:38-0500	<nitrix>	{ indents, } de-indents.
2024-02-03T14:25:35-0500	<nitrix>	Anything that breaks expectations will be harder to read.
2024-02-03T14:26:11-0500	<lavaball>	in my else i disagree. i find it way easier to instantly see where the if ends.
2024-02-03T14:26:31-0500	<lavaball>	but yeah, that wasn't my question. i was wondering if anybody else felt like the else should be indented too.
2024-02-03T14:26:33-0500	<lavaball>	i guess not.
2024-02-03T14:26:37-0500	<lavaball>	thanks a bunch.
2024-02-03T14:26:49-0500	<nitrix>	If you're picking a style for a project, it has very little to do about what you care.
2024-02-03T14:26:50-0500	<bubuche87>	I have a stupid question, more related to gcc or even unix than c.
2024-02-03T14:27:23-0500	<lavaball>	bubuche87, don't hype everybody up by claiming the question is stupid. they are usually perfectly valid.
2024-02-03T14:28:03-0500	<bubuche87>	Given that "gnat1" works (is found and executed) what could cause gcc to say "gnat1 execvp no such file or directory" ?
2024-02-03T14:28:15-0500	<lavaball>	but if i pick the style, isn't what i care the denominating factor?
2024-02-03T14:29:06-0500	<nitrix>	Do what the fuck you want.
2024-02-03T14:29:59-0500	<bubuche87>	Ah, no, gnat1 doesn't work, my bad. Or rather ceased to work (I have the log and it worked before and no longer works). Gnat still works.
2024-02-03T14:31:12-0500	<hergertme>	Company: alacritty is about 3% vs 3.5% when i get old GL renderer + same size vte grid

2024-02-03T14:49:58-0500	<lizardwrangler>	I have this image see, and I can load it into either a pixbuf or a GtkWidget, I want it to update like 20-60 times a second, I know you can't get exact framerates with g_timeout but it's not super important to get an exact framerate, just higher than 1 fps
2024-02-03T14:50:03-0500	<Company>	hergertme: imagine if someone suggested resizing whole line only!!
2024-02-03T14:50:08-0500	<Company>	hehe

2024-02-03T14:51:06-0500	<falsifian>	I would have guessed vis is already using some C library to handle unicode stuff but I don't know that.
2024-02-03T14:51:16-0500	<lizardwrangler>	I feel like im missing something obvious
2024-02-03T14:51:28-0500	<mcepl>	I am not certain but https://docs.gtk.org/glib/func.ascii_tolower.html doesn't look like it can handle Unicode.
2024-02-03T14:51:30-0500	<pragma->	lavaball: I have several different ideas of what your ambiguous "indenting the else" description could mean.
2024-02-03T14:51:32-0500	<lizardwrangler>	but im probably just so blinded with rage that I can't comprehend what it could be
2024-02-03T14:52:20-0500	<mcepl>	I don't think vis does anything about Unicode https://github.com/martanne/vis/wiki/FAQ#how-should-i-edit-files-in-legacy-encodings

2024-02-03T14:53:04-0500	<lavaball>	then why say something in the first place?
2024-02-03T14:53:07-0500	<mcepl>	No, I will just probably leave the original tr-based solution there. I don't care about g~ that much and it would work for most people most likely.
2024-02-03T14:53:19-0500	<mcepl>	we can leave it around as known problem

2024-02-03T14:53:50-0500	<lizardwrangler>	I realize that line 64 is commented out, but it happens with or without that line
2024-02-03T14:54:16-0500	<Company>	your problem is the timeout
2024-02-03T14:54:29-0500	<lizardwrangler>	best I can figure from my debugger it's the "gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf (cr, pixbuf, 0, 0);" line that's throwing the error, but since it works at least once something has to be changing between calls
2024-02-03T14:54:32-0500	<lizardwrangler>	timeout you say?
2024-02-03T14:54:36-0500	<Company>	which you pass the draw function
2024-02-03T14:54:37-0500	<Company>	I think

2024-02-03T14:54:55-0500	<somercet>	GLib has two different tolower functions. One for ASCII, one for UTF-8.
2024-02-03T14:54:59-0500	<pragma->	Because I wanted you to know that your description is completely ambiguous, but I'm not really interested in knowing which concrete implemention you're in fact using. I know how I like my if/else construct to be written.
2024-02-03T14:55:34-0500	<lizardwrangler>	I have it slowed to 2 seconds a frame right now so I can visually verify that it works at least once
2024-02-03T14:55:48-0500	<nitrix>	Yeah, they asked for opinions and advices but the moment they started arguing that they preferred their own style I'm done.

2024-02-03T14:55:58-0500	<lizardwrangler>	if I set it to 16 it still crashes but usually too fast to know if it worked at all
2024-02-03T14:55:58-0500	<nitrix>	These conversations are pointless to have.

2024-02-03T14:56:34-0500	<lavaball>	that's not what i did at all. i even said it twice! i was asking if someone else had the idea of indenting else. there doesn't even need to be any further explanation.
2024-02-03T14:57:28-0500	<nitrix>	From your point of view. There's at least one person who thinks that it should've been worded or explained better.
2024-02-03T14:57:29-0500	<pragma->	I didn't say that you said taht. I said that I know how I like my code to look therefore I'm uninterested in how your code looks. Either it looks like mine and I like it, or it doesn't and I don't like it.
2024-02-03T14:57:50-0500	<lizardwrangler>	iirc it runs an internal loop that does a callback every predetermined time using the function and data passed in

2024-02-03T14:58:33-0500	<pragma->	Because I wanted you to know that there are several different ways "indenting the else" could be constructed.
2024-02-03T14:58:40-0500	<Company>	in the sense that you can't just pass in any function
2024-02-03T14:59:03-0500	<Company>	like, you're passing the draw function that the drawing area calls for drawing
2024-02-03T14:59:19-0500	<lizardwrangler>	oh no
2024-02-03T14:59:26-0500	<Company>	not a timeout function that the internal loop calls for timeouts
2024-02-03T14:59:34-0500	<lavaball>	but that doesn't change anything. doesn't matter how many ways there are. the question was if someone else thought it should be indented.
2024-02-03T15:00:00-0500	<pragma->	It does matter whether you mean the body of the else or the else statement itself.
2024-02-03T15:00:13-0500	<nitrix>	The line, the keyword, the following expression, the block?
2024-02-03T15:00:50-0500	<lizardwrangler>	uhh ok lemmie just 
2024-02-03T15:00:50-0500	<nitrix>	In contrast with you, I mentioned the block and statements, which have clear lexical definitions.
2024-02-03T15:01:02-0500	<Company>	you want to define a timeout function and make that function call gtk_widget_queue_draw()
2024-02-03T15:01:07-0500	<lavaball>	pragma-, that i narrowed down by saying i never see it anywhere else. since everywhere the else body is intended you could deduce  that i meant the statement itself.
2024-02-03T15:01:19-0500	<pragma->	I have no idea where you look at code.
2024-02-03T15:01:22-0500	<Company>	which is the function that tells GTK to go and redraw
2024-02-03T15:01:28-0500	<lavaball>	you already know i read the topic books.
2024-02-03T15:01:34-0500	<Company>	and then GTK will set up everything for drawing and call your draw function
2024-02-03T15:01:38-0500	<lavaball>	you werer the one being confused about me reading style of c first.
2024-02-03T15:01:38-0500	<pragma->	For all I know you've only looked at code at some school in India.
2024-02-03T15:01:52-0500	<lavaball>	i guess you forgot.
2024-02-03T15:02:17-0500	<lavaball>	well, it is how it is. as i said 35 minutes ago. my question has been answerd. thanks a bunch.
2024-02-03T15:02:49-0500	<nitrix>	I think they're either trolling or very young. The nicks cth and egrain don't ring a bell either to me.

2024-02-03T16:05:58-0500	<Matt|home>	what's the actual definition of reference in the C standard

2024-02-03T16:12:53-0500	<johnoo_>	I think I will write /me meow meow enyc in such case :D 
2024-02-03T16:13:10-0500	<NRK>	Matt|home: the line right after the one you quoted answers that: A pointer type describes an object whose value provides a reference to an entity of the referenced type
2024-02-03T16:13:20-0500	<johnoo_>	guys do you in hexchat sounds 
2024-02-03T16:13:50-0500	<somercet>	okay, but you don't need to use any slang you're not clear on just because you're in IRC. It's just like real life.
2024-02-03T16:14:19-0500	<nitrix>	Matt|home, C11 6.2.5p20 "A pointer type may be derived from a function type or an object type, called the referenced type. A pointer type describes an object whose value provides a reference to an entity of the referenced type. A pointer type derived from the referenced type T is sometimes called ââpointer to T ââ."
2024-02-03T16:14:23-0500	<stealth_>	its, k no big deal 
2024-02-03T16:14:24-0500	<johnoo_>	in preferences where I should add sound so hexchat beeps when someone writes message to me in chatroom. - I get notification blinking icon but it does not beep 
2024-02-03T16:14:24-0500	<somercet>	we have alert noises, but can't play random audio at each other, outside of YT links and such.
2024-02-03T16:14:34-0500	<sney>	I don't think I've had an alert sound enabled since it was x-chat 2
2024-02-03T16:15:54-0500	<nitrix>	Matt|home, In other words, there isn't a construct called a "reference" like in C++, but rather, there's a concept of objects referencing other objects, which we call pointers, and could also be named indirection.
2024-02-03T16:16:04-0500	<johnoo_>	for example I set it for add notify beep generic message message send notice send and many other for example private message and I get the beep when someone writes me private message
2024-02-03T16:16:24-0500	<johnoo_>	but when someone in channel writes me I get notification but not beep ... 
2024-02-03T16:16:35-0500	<somercet>	johnoo_, no beep?
2024-02-03T16:17:03-0500	<somercet>	it may not beep if you're looking at the page. That is also a setting.
2024-02-03T16:17:30-0500	<johnoo_>	yes that is correct by when I minimize 
2024-02-03T16:17:50-0500	<johnoo_>	and I get some notification blinking icon but sometimes I miss it 
2024-02-03T16:18:19-0500	<johnoo_>	so it would be great if I could turn on sound for that
2024-02-03T16:20:31-0500	<johnoo_>	that is ok :) that was what another guys told me that I am overthinking it - meows does not mean anything but I was not sure how the guy is doing it - I am new to irc
2024-02-03T16:20:41-0500	<johnoo_>	but you explained that it is doen with /me
2024-02-03T16:21:50-0500	<Filystyn>	thx madx
2024-02-03T16:21:58-0500	<johnoo_>	good night 
2024-02-03T16:22:25-0500	<somercet>	Make sure these are off under Settings-Alerts: "Omit alerts when marked as being away" "Omit alerts while the window is focused"
2024-02-03T16:23:30-0500	<johnoo_>	hmm notifications work correctly I think, I am just looking for an event for when person writes me
2024-02-03T16:23:34-0500	<nitrix>	e.g. int x; int *p; // Here `x` is an object of type `int`. `p` is another object, this one will be referring to the type of `x` so it'll have a derived type `int *` (`pointer to an int`).
2024-02-03T16:24:07-0500	<johnoo_>	so in settings of sounds I could add there sound I want to
2024-02-03T16:24:37-0500	<johnoo_>	writes me on a channel 
2024-02-03T16:24:46-0500	<nitrix>	If you want another derived example, `int [5]` (and array of 5 int) is also a derived type from `int`.
2024-02-03T16:25:29-0500	<johnoo_>	because when I have hexchat open that is ok, do not need it but when I minimize it hmm I get ! icon blinking but sound would be good 
2024-02-03T16:27:15-0500	<nitrix>	And so is struct { int y; };
2024-02-03T16:27:46-0500	<johnoo_>	I am going to sleep but if you know or find out answer for the topic of sound event for message on a channel please write me here or on channel (if you want) thanks. 
2024-02-03T16:28:27-0500	<johnoo_>	*direct message on a channel because there is event for message on a channel but that is for every message ... 
2024-02-03T16:30:04-0500	<nitrix>	Only pointers are "referencing" though, due to their indirection. They're objects that leads you to other objects, unlike aggregates (arrays, structs) that are objects containing other objects.

2024-02-03T20:07:00-0500	<JanC>	I think the easiest is to compile against the one included in the Gtk bundle that you can download from the HexChat site?
2024-02-03T20:07:03-0500	<nmz>	lua does have utf8 library, and I do know that upper/lower for ASCII is just [+-]32

2024-02-03T21:10:51-0500	<pabs3>	is there a plugin that can save and restore marker lines when restarting hexchat?
2024-02-03T21:11:07-0500	<pabs3>	and one to save and restore messages that have been written but not sent yet?
2024-02-03T21:11:29-0500	<pabs3>	and one to re-open /query windows after restarting?
2024-02-03T21:31:03-0500	<JanC>	I don't know if any plugins/scripts exist already, but it's possible to get/set the content of the text entry box for each context, and to loop over the open contexts (servers/channels/queries/...), so at least saving/restoring those are possible in theory
2024-02-03T21:32:58-0500	<JanC>	and getting/setting the marker lines might be possible through Gtk? just a guess...
2024-02-03T21:40:07-0500	<JanC>	the hardest part might be to save all that before HexChat exits in all cases...?
2024-02-03T21:44:37-0500	<pabs3>	hmm, might be best as a patch instead
2024-02-03T21:47:59-0500	<pabs3>	do you think saving the marker line in the scrollback files would be the best approach?
2024-02-03T21:51:41-0500	<falsifian>	nmz: For Unicode I think it comes down to looking everything up in a table. Lua's utf8 library is unfortunately just about the utf-8 encoding, which does not help with things like that.
2024-02-03T21:53:03-0500	<falsifian>	e.g. https://unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html#1
2024-02-03T21:55:55-0500	<nmz>	I don't think so, Ã  for example is c3, all of the a's are c3, so its a matter of bitflipping
2024-02-03T21:56:48-0500	<falsifian>	What's c3?
2024-02-03T21:57:45-0500	<nmz>	0000000   c3  a0  c3  80  c3  a1  c3  81  nl                            
2024-02-03T21:57:48-0500	<nmz>	           Ã   **   Ã  **   Ã¡  **   Ã  **  \n 
2024-02-03T21:58:35-0500	<nmz>	so its a matter of finding the modifier in hex, and knowing how to convert that
2024-02-03T21:58:53-0500	<nmz>	quinq will correct me and say its not called a modifier
2024-02-03T21:58:56-0500	<falsifian>	Are you suggesting every utf-8 sequence starting with c3 can have the same rule applied to flip case?
2024-02-03T21:58:57-0500	<nmz>	diacritic? accent?
2024-02-03T22:00:40-0500	<nmz>	I think so, unicode did adopt certain tricks from certain encodings
2024-02-03T22:00:56-0500	<nmz>	same as the -32 from tolower
2024-02-03T22:01:54-0500	<falsifian>	I doubt there is a set of simple tricks that will cover everything. Upper-casing can even change the number of characters; uppercase of Ã is SS.
2024-02-03T22:02:07-0500	<falsifian>	https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/ch05.pdf#G21180
2024-02-03T22:02:30-0500	<falsifian>	^ Some information there; Ã is under the "Change in Length" subheading.
2024-02-03T22:03:48-0500	<falsifian>	Lots of other nightmares listed there.
2024-02-03T22:04:18-0500	<nmz>	aye
2024-02-03T22:04:35-0500	<nmz>	where is Ã used?
2024-02-03T22:04:40-0500	<falsifian>	German.
2024-02-03T22:04:57-0500	<falsifian>	There's a whole subheading about "German sharp s"; I think that's the same thing.
2024-02-03T22:05:28-0500	<falsifian>	But I have seen enough German to know that letter appears a lot.
2024-02-03T22:05:45-0500	<nmz>	I only care about spanish, which is just a diacritic on the vowels and Ã±
2024-02-03T22:06:35-0500	<falsifian>	Ah, maybe you can get away with a trick then :) I think some of those characters have multiple ways of being represented as sequences of Unicode codepoints, btw. So you might think you've covered it, and then encounter a textfile that uses the other way.
2024-02-03T22:07:14-0500	<falsifian>	I don't know if this is actually an example, but e.g. Ã© could be either an accent + the letter e, or a single unicode codepoint that is Ã© all together.

2024-02-03T22:13:02-0500	<nmz>	you're right, but also, bah, I don't care about those other ways, it was a mistake to include them
2024-02-03T22:24:31-0500	<pabs3>	hmm, would also want to save messages that have been sent, so up-arrow still works
2024-02-03T22:30:34-0500	<JanC>	so basically a history file  :)
2024-02-03T22:30:51-0500	<JanC>	well, a whole bunch of them

2024-02-03T23:22:33-0500	<somercet>	no offense, but that sounds like a low-grade coding/file nightmare...
2024-02-03T23:25:00-0500	<pabs3>	why? its not much different to the existing scrollback files
2024-02-03T23:25:34-0500	<somercet>	have you looked inside those?
2024-02-03T23:26:08-0500	<pabs3>	yeah, pretty simple. T character, numeric timestamp, message text including colours

2024-02-03T23:30:09-0500	<somercet>	saving the marker line would be easiest if hexchat was hooked up to dconf.
2024-02-03T23:32:35-0500	<somercet>	I finally got stateful menu options again. Now I can test showing/hiding the time stamps as a GSetting.
2024-02-03T23:32:41-0500	<pabs3>	eww dconf
2024-02-03T23:32:58-0500	<somercet>	And of course, this all ties into that damned search function... :-P
2024-02-03T23:33:32-0500	<somercet>	or, you know, just add another *.conf file...
2024-02-03T23:34:44-0500	<somercet>	saving the markers in the scrollback... that would leave a lot of markers in the history, which would show up as extraneous characters, or as extra lines...
2024-02-03T23:36:25-0500	<pabs3>	ahh, looking at the code the scrollback lines are indeed appended to the existing files
2024-02-03T23:37:36-0500	<somercet>	well, yes, they are also open 100% of the time...
2024-02-03T23:37:56-0500	<somercet>	or they were
2024-02-03T23:38:21-0500	<pabs3>	ok, definitely markers would have to be in different files then
2024-02-03T23:38:34-0500	<somercet>	No, I was wrong, the logs are...
2024-02-03T23:39:52-0500	<somercet>	ugh, what's the linux command that verbosely describes each file? lstat, or...?
2024-02-03T23:41:27-0500	<pabs3>	stat
2024-02-03T23:41:36-0500	<pabs3>	or ls -l
2024-02-03T23:42:34-0500	<somercet>	stat, ty
2024-02-03T23:42:43-0500	<pabs3>	looks like in memory the markers are a pointer to a text line, which is a timestamp + text and some other stuff
2024-02-03T23:43:16-0500	<pabs3>	so probably just storing that timestamp would be enough, then when restoring scrollback you put the marker line in the appropriate place
2024-02-03T23:43:27-0500	<somercet>	mmm

2024-02-04T11:32:54-0500	<feaneron>	so, how is dmabuf texture diffing supposed to work?
2024-02-04T11:33:36-0500	<feaneron>	i'm passing an update texture + a damage region, and yet, gtk diffs the entire widget
2024-02-04T11:38:53-0500	<minimal>	#join #openwrt-devel
2024-02-04T11:40:18-0500	<Company>	in theory, that's all you need
2024-02-04T11:41:08-0500	<Company>	in practice I have no idea if it's busted - it's copy/paste code from the GL texture, but I don't remember me or anyone else ever testing it
2024-02-04T11:42:55-0500	<feaneron>	man
2024-02-04T11:43:10-0500	<feaneron>	webkit code is complicated
2024-02-04T11:44:54-0500	<Company>	are you trying to get webkit damage regions into the GTK process?
2024-02-04T11:45:06-0500	<feaneron>	yes
2024-02-04T11:45:20-0500	<feaneron>	or rather, i'm merely playing around with the code to see how difficult it would be to do that
2024-02-04T11:45:43-0500	<Company>	that just means sending a region with the frame signal, or?
2024-02-04T11:45:50-0500	<feaneron>	webkitgtk already has code to create dmabuf textures using GdkDmabufBuilder
2024-02-04T11:46:23-0500	<Company>	yeah, I know, I reviewed that when it landed last week to make Vulkan work
2024-02-04T11:46:42-0500	<Company>	*to make Vulkan work fast
2024-02-04T11:46:54-0500	<feaneron>	vulkan is definitely not working here anymore
2024-02-04T11:47:02-0500	<feaneron>	after the dmabuf builder code, that is
2024-02-04T11:47:28-0500	<Company>	not working at all or not fast?
2024-02-04T11:47:45-0500	<feaneron>	it's not working at all, and it's very slow at that :)
2024-02-04T11:48:02-0500	<Company>	you're on Intel with a 23.x Mesa?
2024-02-04T11:48:14-0500	<feaneron>	i'm on amd with whatever older mesa
2024-02-04T11:48:27-0500	<Company>	huh, interesting
2024-02-04T11:49:29-0500	<Company>	it's the fun of the drivers being different and using different dmabuf modifiers
2024-02-04T11:51:32-0500	<Company>	and webkit is the first case of dmabufs being generated by GL and then consumed by Vulkan
2024-02-04T11:51:56-0500	<Company>	node-editor does it the other way, and that seems to work reasonably well
2024-02-04T11:52:40-0500	<tankf33der>	hi all
2024-02-04T11:53:10-0500	<tankf33der>	does anyone use MAILFROM in busybox crontab? Does not work. 
2024-02-04T11:54:08-0500	<tankf33der>	MAILTO respects.
2024-02-04T11:54:43-0500	<lopid>	is it supposed to?
2024-02-04T11:55:14-0500	<tankf33der>	how to check? :/
2024-02-04T11:55:50-0500	<tankf33der>	i checked crond, cronie - all failed.
2024-02-04T11:56:11-0500	<tankf33der>	crond is another package
2024-02-04T11:56:38-0500	<minimal>	"how to check?" - look at source code?
2024-02-04T11:56:45-0500	<tankf33der>	so three cron software does not respect MAILFROM.
2024-02-04T11:56:52-0500	<lopid>	i have not heard of MAILFROM in any cron variant
2024-02-04T11:56:52-0500	<tankf33der>	minimal: ok
2024-02-04T11:57:01-0500	<dalias>	what is it supposed to do?
2024-02-04T11:57:23-0500	<tankf33der>	format From address and name in mail of cron output
2024-02-04T11:57:53-0500	<feaneron>	i think it generates dmabufs using gbm
2024-02-04T11:57:58-0500	<dalias>	does busybox cron even do mail? how do you configure it ?
2024-02-04T11:58:24-0500	<minimal>	yes Busybox crond supports "MAILTO="

2024-02-04T12:00:49-0500	<dalias>	ahh it looks for sendmail in path rather than /usr/lib/sendmail
2024-02-04T12:01:03-0500	<dalias>	that would explain it never working :-p

2024-02-04T12:13:14-0500	<lizardwrangler>	hey thanks fella!
2024-02-04T12:13:33-0500	<somercet>	It's kinda digressive, but it gets a lot of info in there.
2024-02-04T12:13:41-0500	<lizardwrangler>	digressive?
2024-02-04T12:13:53-0500	<lizardwrangler>	like he starts ranting off topic?
2024-02-04T12:13:58-0500	<somercet>	more like... messily comprehensive
2024-02-04T12:13:59-0500	<Company>	feaneron: yeah, everyone ultimately uses gbm, the question about compatibility is more about how the modifier is selected
2024-02-04T12:14:07-0500	<lizardwrangler>	ah
2024-02-04T12:14:12-0500	<kurahaupo>	,cc if(0)foo:puts("bar"); else {void(*f)()=&foo; f();} // does gcc still allow this?
2024-02-04T12:14:13-0500	<candide>	kurahaupo: error: 'foo' undeclared
2024-02-04T12:14:22-0500	<lizardwrangler>	thats good for me then, I need lots o smart makings
2024-02-04T12:14:37-0500	<feaneron>	Company: i actually just realized i was building webkit poorly, and it wasn't picking up gtk from my host system. it's rebuilding now. let's see how it goes
2024-02-04T12:14:39-0500	<Company>	feaneron: there's an env var to override the modifier, carlosgc used that to make things work for him
2024-02-04T12:14:40-0500	<ski>	need `&&foo', i think ?
2024-02-04T12:14:48-0500	<kurahaupo>	,cc if(0)foo:puts("bar"); else {void(*f)()=&&foo; f();} // does gcc still allow this?
2024-02-04T12:14:54-0500	<somercet>	he has a lot of playlists on GAction and all that
2024-02-04T12:14:57-0500	<V-T60>	What is auto_char?
2024-02-04T12:14:57-0500	<candide>	kurahaupo: [warning: taking the address of a label is non-standard [-Wpedantic]  warning: ISO C forbids initialization between function pointer and 'void *' [-Wpedantic]] [gdb time-out]
2024-02-04T12:15:00-0500	<ski>	or, `__label__ foo;' or something
2024-02-04T12:15:04-0500	<sonya>	proxychains4 irssi
2024-02-04T12:15:05-0500	<V-T60>	How do I know from which library is that?
2024-02-04T12:15:55-0500	<somercet>	Speaking of: am I right in thinking that subpaths in glib-schemas (GSettings) need to be loaded individually?
2024-02-04T12:16:08-0500	<kurahaupo>	,cc if(0)foo:puts("bar"); else {void*f=&&foo; goto*f;}
2024-02-04T12:16:09-0500	<candide>	kurahaupo: [warning: taking the address of a label is non-standard [-Wpedantic]  warning: ISO C forbids 'goto *expr;' [-Wpedantic]] bar
2024-02-04T12:16:42-0500	<somercet>	I was stuck choosing between, e.g. "/myprog/viewport" and "font-size", or "myprog" "viewport-font-size"?
2024-02-04T12:17:08-0500	<ski>	fwiw, my test was about whether `foo: puts("bar");' was treated as `foo:; puts("bar");' or not, after that `if (0)'
2024-02-04T12:17:51-0500	<minimal>	tankf33der: MAILFROM is supported by the cronie package
2024-02-04T12:17:53-0500	<ski>	kurahaupo : guess you need to turn off the warnings, to make candide run it ?
2024-02-04T12:18:29-0500	<pragma->	It ran it. See the "bar" at the end?
2024-02-04T12:18:43-0500	<ski>	oh .. so it did. sorry, missed that
2024-02-04T12:25:11-0500	<V-T60>	where should i look for config.h? if there are lots of #include "config.h" in files
2024-02-04T12:25:21-0500	<V-T60>	is that possible that config.h doesn't even exist?
2024-02-04T12:25:27-0500	<V-T60>	can it be created later on?
2024-02-04T12:25:50-0500	<rbox>	config.h is generated soemtimes
2024-02-04T12:39:40-0500	<seninha>	Hi, is it a good idea for a library function to set errno? Even if it is to "save" the errno after a failure? like here: https://termbin.com/d4ea
2024-02-04T12:41:19-0500	<emanuele6>	you have to set errno to call many C apis correctly
2024-02-04T12:42:12-0500	<emanuele6>	e.g. the correct way to call strtod() is     char *endptr; errno = 0; long x = strtod(str, &endptr, 10); if (errno) { .... ;}
2024-02-04T12:42:49-0500	<emanuele6>	functions only set errno on error, so you can only safely check errno to verify if there was an overflow/underflow if you set it to 0 first
2024-02-04T12:42:58-0500	<emanuele6>	so yeah, it is completely safe to set errno
2024-02-04T12:44:53-0500	<madx>	the function usually tells you if there is an error, so you don't need to set errno to zero before for those
2024-02-04T12:45:45-0500	<emanuele6>	for strtod() you do need to though
2024-02-04T12:45:46-0500	<seninha>	emanuele6: in the example case, it is not the program calling the C api who needs to set errno (like zeroing before calling, as in your example). It is the C api who sets errno, by saving an early (possibly overwritten) value.
2024-02-04T12:47:00-0500	<seninha>	that may mask a possible later error, which i dont know whether it's a good practice
2024-02-04T12:47:08-0500	<emanuele6>	you decide what errno to have your function set at the end; i have seen many function that save error before trying to write a debug message to stderr, and then restore it
2024-02-04T12:47:25-0500	<emanuele6>	s/error/errno/
2024-02-04T12:48:40-0500	<emanuele6>	err in that example i meant to use strtol, not strtod, but anyway strtod is the same
2024-02-04T12:49:11-0500	<madx>	seninha: setting errno to report a error in your functions is up to you, it doesn't interfere with anything
2024-02-04T12:49:52-0500	<seninha>	i see... i just have not seen many (non-standard) libraries reporting errors through errno, so i thought whether that could be a good practice
2024-02-04T12:49:56-0500	<madx>	it makes your functions follow to posix logic
2024-02-04T12:50:08-0500	<madx>	s/follow to/follow the/
2024-02-04T12:50:58-0500	<madx>	you're also limited to the possible values of errno
2024-02-04T12:51:06-0500	<madx>	which may not be enough
2024-02-04T12:52:01-0500	<seninha>	madx: in my case i am not setting errno to any constant value, but to whatever malloc sets when failing
2024-02-04T12:53:11-0500	<Filystyn>	seninha often you want to zero errno
2024-02-04T12:53:20-0500	<Filystyn>	but i dislike to use error codes in lib api
2024-02-04T12:53:29-0500	<Filystyn>	I rather have my own error codes
2024-02-04T12:54:02-0500	<seninha>	most apis just enum'erate possible errors, usually with non-zero constants, and return one of them on error.  I think that's for portability with non-posix and to not limit to any implementation's set of error constants.
2024-02-04T12:55:13-0500	<tankf33der>	minimal:sigh
2024-02-04T12:55:59-0500	<emanuele6>	note that errno is standard C, not specifically POSIX
2024-02-04T12:56:03-0500	<Filystyn>	for example when you have error and close some fds  you save the errno, close the fds and than put saved errno back to errno
2024-02-04T12:56:26-0500	<Filystyn>	in function so user on return won't cath wrong error
2024-02-04T12:56:39-0500	<Filystyn>	if function retunr -1 fail for example
2024-02-04T12:56:41-0500	<emanuele6>	but not the all the POSIX codes are standard C
2024-02-04T12:57:24-0500	<emanuele6>	the reason why you should not invent your own errnos is that perror() won't know about them
2024-02-04T12:58:35-0500	<Filystyn>	does C standard even define any error codes
2024-02-04T12:58:58-0500	<Filystyn>	I thought that is platform specific always
2024-02-04T12:59:17-0500	<emanuele6>	yes. e.g. the aforementioned strtol sets errno to ERANGE when there is an overflow or underflow.
2024-02-04T12:59:43-0500	<Filystyn>	gona look into standard later
2024-02-04T12:59:50-0500	<Filystyn>	best would be not to define any tbh
2024-02-04T13:00:21-0500	<minimal>	well you've got your options now...
2024-02-04T13:00:31-0500	<Filystyn>	on the other hand yeah here is is a must
2024-02-04T13:00:56-0500	<Filystyn>	but fread printf it's a mess hehe
2024-02-04T13:03:04-0500	<tankf33der>	tried hours with cronie, no success
2024-02-04T13:03:14-0500	<tankf33der>	MAILFROM does not respect
2024-02-04T13:03:27-0500	<tankf33der>	switched back to busybox
2024-02-04T13:03:59-0500	*	pyooque is now known as puke
2024-02-04T13:03:59-0500	<minimal>	both the cronie manpages and the cronie code indicate support for MAILFROM
2024-02-04T13:05:04-0500	<tankf33der>	sure, uses login@domain name without respect.
2024-02-04T13:05:20-0500	<tankf33der>	root@my.domain or so
2024-02-04T13:05:21-0500	<tankf33der>	:)
2024-02-04T13:05:25-0500	<minimal>	how does code give respect?
2024-02-04T13:05:47-0500	<tankf33der>	should be mike@gmail.com
2024-02-04T13:06:03-0500	<tankf33der>	MAILFROM=mike@gmail.com
2024-02-04T13:06:07-0500	<tankf33der>	MAILFROM="mike@gmail.com"
2024-02-04T13:06:10-0500	<tankf33der>	MAILFROM="<mike@gmail.com>"
2024-02-04T13:06:16-0500	<tankf33der>	all combinations checked.
2024-02-04T13:06:42-0500	<tankf33der>	root@my.domain and bounce by remote MTA :)
2024-02-04T13:08:10-0500	<minimal>	you haven't exactly defined the problem - have you looked at the emails being generated when you set MAILFROM?
2024-02-04T13:11:02-0500	<tankf33der>	yeap, i see root@my.domain from string without gmail
2024-02-04T13:13:43-0500	<minimal>	you see this on the machine itself? (not relying on looking at bounces)
2024-02-04T13:14:12-0500	<minimal>	havre you checked the logfiles to see if cronie is giving warnings/errors?
2024-02-04T13:15:51-0500	<tankf33der>	never mind, thank you for you time!

2024-02-04T13:17:26-0500	<minimal>	tankf33der: you don't want to try and fix your problem?
2024-02-04T13:19:46-0500	<tankf33der>	if i used cronie, i see mail in the log and it bounced and rejected because came from root@my.domain
2024-02-04T13:20:00-0500	<tankf33der>	i already spent hours in this.
2024-02-04T13:20:08-0500	<tankf33der>	i would like take a break.
2024-02-04T13:20:36-0500	<minimal>	well from a brief look at the code I would expect when you tried  MAILFROM="<mike@gmail.com>" that an error would appear in the logfiles
2024-02-04T13:20:57-0500	<minimal>	as cronie does not appear to allow "<" or ">" as characters in an email address
2024-02-04T13:21:19-0500	<minimal>	which is why I asked if you checked the logs
2024-02-04T13:21:22-0500	<tankf33der>	no syntax error from cronie
2024-02-04T13:21:41-0500	<tankf33der>	maybe i was on busybox all this time? :)
2024-02-04T13:24:20-0500	<tankf33der>	now my tor relay is broken. what a day.
2024-02-04T13:25:06-0500	<madx>	seninha: note that posix uses a second logic for pthread functions: functions return zero on success and an error code on failure (using errno's constants), any value to return is done with pointers given as arguments
2024-02-04T13:31:32-0500	<lizardwrangler>	is there a benifit to using gktapplication vs gtk window?
2024-02-04T13:45:09-0500	<somercet>	https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/application.html
2024-02-04T13:50:51-0500	<lizardwrangler>	I just meant from a personal point of view, is there something that would cripple me if I didn't use an application
2024-02-04T13:51:24-0500	<lizardwrangler>	or is that answer too vague and dependent on too many factors to give a meaningful answer?
2024-02-04T13:53:28-0500	<somercet>	Hexchat runs on GTK2, but it does not use GtkApplication.
2024-02-04T13:54:30-0500	<feaneron>	lizardwrangler: it's usually a good idea to use GApplication or GtkApplication, it's mostly useful if you want to integrate the app with the desktop environment in various ways
2024-02-04T13:54:47-0500	<feaneron>	GApplication has api to send notifications, to inhibit the session, etc
2024-02-04T13:54:54-0500	<feaneron>	ensure app uniqueness
2024-02-04T13:55:41-0500	<feaneron>	GtkApplication adds a few interesting things on top of that
2024-02-04T13:55:44-0500	<feaneron>	you might want to read https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html

2024-02-04T14:25:49-0500	<lizardwrangler>	this is much nicer than wxwidgets
2024-02-04T14:26:03-0500	<lizardwrangler>	where the answer to most question is "go fuck yourself"
2024-02-04T14:33:11-0500	<seninha>	madx: yeah, that's a better interface imo, so i do not even need to change errno on lib side (which may break programmers code somehow? i cant think on any usecase when library changing errno can interfer the programmer)
2024-02-04T14:34:38-0500	<seninha>	gonna use that, my lib in question (for a ipc protocol) just need to notify about allocation error (usually ENOMEM) or communication error (usually ETIMEDOUT).
2024-02-04T14:35:37-0500	<seninha>	I am gonna check whether those are required by POSIX or standard C, so i do not use any system-specific error code
2024-02-04T14:36:58-0500	<seninha>	and just define an enum of error codes in the header file if that's the case (which would be a waste of lines of code to define just two constants for allocation and timeout error)
2024-02-04T15:00:56-0500	<Filystyn>	if it's in docs it's fine
2024-02-04T15:02:40-0500	<Filystyn>	also returning errno or passing it on pointed memory sucks imho. never was a fan of how pthreads do that. but it is not a big deal

2024-02-04T16:23:56-0500	<nightfrog>	Which version of python?
2024-02-04T16:40:43-0500	<mort>	isn't it weird that the built-in language feature sizeof returns the library type size_t instead of a built-in type
2024-02-04T16:41:49-0500	<johnjaye>	c has a lot of weird things in it.
2024-02-04T16:47:39-0500	<lowin>	isn't size_t just a typedef to a primitive type though?
2024-02-04T16:49:22-0500	<lowin>	oh its actually typedef'd to __SIZE_TYPE__ on my platform
2024-02-04T16:52:36-0500	<sham1>	size_t isn't really a library type as such. It's defined in the standard, after all, so it's not like you could ever be in a situation where you wouldn't have it.
2024-02-04T16:52:46-0500	<sham1>	Well, unless you're in some weird non-standard environment
2024-02-04T16:53:35-0500	<sham1>	The fact that for example gcc on my system typedefs it as usigned long long int is an implementation detail
2024-02-04T16:54:11-0500	<sham1>	It could just as easily be a bespoke type in the compiler

2024-02-04T17:05:49-0500	<pekster>	It's better thought about as an abstraction layer (for benefit of implementations to Do The Right Thingâ¢) instead of a "library" type. Unless by library you mean the standard C library (specifically, <stddef.h>) but that's available even in the minimal headers available to a freestanding (non-hosted) environment.
2024-02-04T17:58:00-0500	*	jason_ is now known as Guest5177
2024-02-04T17:59:21-0500	<mort>	that's exactly what I mean, that it's in <stddef.h> unlike, say, int which is builtin
2024-02-04T17:59:32-0500	<mort>	I guess the same applies to subtracting pointers and ptrdiff_t
2024-02-04T17:59:47-0500	<mort>	just feels weird that we're all writing these expressions all the time which results in types which haven't been defined
2024-02-04T18:01:44-0500	<bubuche87>	I learnt that several things I would have thought are well defined actually aren't.
2024-02-04T18:02:22-0500	<bubuche87>	Like using a shift operation with a right operand greater than the number of bits of the left operand.
2024-02-04T18:05:20-0500	<JanC>	I meant how & where the module is installed
2024-02-04T18:12:40-0500	<famine>	bubuche87, that is well defined
2024-02-04T18:15:30-0500	<bubuche87>	Maybe not in C++ ? I don't know, I recently read a pdf made by (among others) Stroustrup, for critical systems (F-35 ? Airplanes), and it's one thing mentioned.
2024-02-04T18:19:28-0500	<bubuche87>	(I can search the information in the pdf but it will swap application and android will likely disconnect me from here).
2024-02-04T18:19:35-0500	<humm>	APic: I now feel silly; I always thought :: was just a nicer-looking alias for rem.
2024-02-04T18:21:09-0500	<famine>	bubuche87, it's not well defined between architectures is the problem, on x86 uint8_t A = 0xFF; A = A >> 33; will set A = 0x00; and clear the carry flag
2024-02-04T18:22:00-0500	<bubuche87>	As opposed to ?

2024-02-04T18:23:06-0500	<bubuche87>	(also, c++ (and I think c) don't have an >>> (three, yes) operator like java. As a consequence >> on negative integers is also an issue).
2024-02-04T18:23:44-0500	<bubuche87>	In the first example it's an uint8_t so the two cases aren't comparable.

2024-02-04T19:27:21-0500	<andrewrk>	you can choose glibc or musl with -target
2024-02-04T19:27:32-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Ah, I see.
2024-02-04T19:27:57-0500	<andrewrk>	glibc is dynamic linked, so unless that security issue is in the static bits (unlikely) then glibc distros likely have it patched already and it's not really an issue for application developers to care about
2024-02-04T19:28:10-0500	<andrewrk>	just do a system update and you're fine
2024-02-04T19:29:16-0500	<remiliascarlet>	Yeah, I'm compiling the patched version, since I'm on a source-based distro.

2024-02-04T21:28:11-0500	<chair22>	for instance, the two authors ultimately suggest banning #ifdef entirely from source .c files
